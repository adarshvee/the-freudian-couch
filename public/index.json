This was when life permitted me the time to do so. Maybe some day, it will grant me this luxary once again.\nI have been blogging on and off since 2009, so there is a good chance that I might have written about something you like.

This was the year when I made a conscious effort to change this and get back into reading more. One contributor to my reading slump, apart from life, was my antiquated reading habits. I might have described these in the past: I read only one book at a time, I try very hard to not abandon books midway, and I am rarely critical enough of any book to consider it a waste of time. These quirks make it easy for me to get stuck with a book that I find hard to read, feel guilty about giving up, and too possessive to share reading time with another book.\u0026nbsp;\nI also rarely read things online anymore, and realizing this made me very sad. I remember being at my creative best when I read widely. I tried looking at ways to increase my online reading - subscriptions, feeds, apps – nothing worked. If you haven’t noticed, the internet has been a quagmire lately. Our plan to confuse LLMs by dumping the internet with low-quality content and making useful things hard to find is going swimmingly well. I eventually had a eureka moment, and decided to go to a public library to borrow physical copies of magazines. This has been so great that I am ending 2024 on a reading high. I have also been writing about books more frequently, and I hope I can continue doing this. Writing often makes me a more perceptive reader.\nI started this year with Amor Towles’s The Lincoln Highway. Towles is known for his more popular A Gentleman in Moscow. The Lincoln Highway, my introduction to Towles, returned mixed results for me. I went in expecting historical fiction. The first few chapters were grim, but the book turned into a fun journey. But then, things shifted tone again. I did not have a consistent emotional reaction to the book. In an interview, the author had compared “history” in his fiction to some detail in the backdrop of a live theatre performance: it’s not the main action, but if you happen to look, you get something to mull about. That’s a fair take. It was just not what I was looking for at that point of time. I am reluctant to say too much about this book because I feel I am judging it very harshly, and I do not want to dissuade others from trying this book.\nI read Don Norman’s The Design of Everyday Things because I wanted to become better at designing user experiences. Don coined the term “user-centered design” in 1986, and this is a classic book on design principles. Embarking into what was then uncharted territory, Don Norman proposes a theory on how humans act. While very complete and informative, The Design of Everyday Things is also very academic. It also goes into elaborate details of certain engineering processes which should be familiar to modern software engineers. At various points through the book, I found myself wishing I had picked up a more modern and less academic book. This is not a reflection of the book itself. It might just be that this is not a topic that interests me as much, and the last thing I wanted was a series of categorized lists that felt like preparing for a quiz.\nThe Color of Magic by Terry Pratchett is a short, witty, and satirical book that was so-so. It is part of the Discworld series, which is supposed to get much more engaging as it progresses. I might get back to the series at some point of time, but I am in no hurry to do so. The fact that there are forty-one books in the series scares me.\nIt’s becoming a personal tradition for me to read one book by Umberto Eco every year. I may not actually read one, but hey, it is the thought that counts. This year, I read The Prague Cemetery. The Prague Cemetery tracks Simone Simonini, a fictional forger. Simone finds himself entangled with historic figures and the political upheavals of 19th-century Europe. He eventually creates The Protocols of the Elders of Zion - a forged document that supposedly exposes a Jewish plot to take over the levers of the world. In not-so-dark corners of the internet, you can find people who refer to this document to this day as if it is accurate. The Prague Cemetery is an excellent book, but like Eco's The Name of the Rose and Foucault Pendulum, it is exceedingly hard to read. Anyone interested in how and why conspiracy theories originate and propagate would benefit immensely from reading Eco. Reading Eco is laborious, but has rich rewards.\nFahrenheit 451 is a terse, action-packed dystopian novel that imagines a future where firemen are tasked with burning books instead of preventing fires. The dystopian world created by Bradbury is more Huxley than Orwell. In other words, people are captive by choice rather than by force. Fahrenheit 451 is still, and unfortunately perpetually, relevant.\nAs a Tamil speaker, one of my regrets is not being able to read enough Tamil to delve into my native literature. A couple of years ago, I made a resolution to read more translated works from India, and I decided to start with Jeyamohan. Priyamvada translates Jeyamohan’s collection of short stories called Aram very competently into Stories of the True. At various moments, I found myself mentally translating Priyamvada’s words back to Tamil and imagining the dialogues spoken by different characters. I am extremely glad that I read this book. Jeyamohan’s stories are raw and deal with complicated characters. They challenge the reader to participate in unraveling the stories. My favorite from this collection was probably Meal Tally, which is the sweetest and most uplifting tale in this wonderful book.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\nContinuing my quest to discover my own culture, I planned to read the Indian epic - Mahabharata. After a short research (in the age of internet, I have learnt to keep “research” short), I landed on an edition of The Mahabharata: A Modern Rendering Vol 1 by Ramesh Menon. I, like many Indians, read a version of Mahabharata as a kid. It’s not easy to escape various short fables from this epic if you grow up in India. But Ramesh Menon treats the epic like an erotic fantasy. And to me, this treatment makes complete sense. Instead of glossing over elements that could be seen as implausible by modern society, Menon leans into the fantastical elements. The result is gripping. As an example, the section where Krishna and Arjuna help Agni burn the Khandava forest is dynamic. On the other hand, some elements of an epic that’s believed to have been authored by multiple writers at various points of time become repetitive. That does seem like a fault of the translator. I plan to read the second and final volume in 2025.\nI have already written about Margaret Atwood’s Burning Questions, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, and Frederik Backman’s Anxious People. I enjoyed all three books, but I enjoyed Anxious People the most.\nI ended 2024 the way I started it. Like with Lincoln Highway, Delia Owens’s extremely popular Where the Crawdads Sing left me unsure of what to make of it. Structuring her novel like an investigation thriller, Delia Owens describes the marshlands of North Carolina with stunning detail. But the plot itself is simple, and often far-fetched. Characters do not behave the way we would expect them to. I thought long and hard about reviewing this book and not breaking my writing streak. However, I did not have much to add to the discourse on this bestseller, and I found many other reviews which expressed my thoughts more effectively than I could ever hope to.\nIn 2025, I might want to fit in another book by Umberto Eco, and the second volume of Ramesh Menon’s Mahabharata. But then, I am whimsical with picking my next reads. I look forward to seeing what catches my fancy next year. I begin with an open slate, and I am very excited to read more. Happy reading, and a happy new year!\u0026nbsp;\n","date":"31 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-2024-in-books/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My 2024 in books","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/year-in-review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Year-in-Review","type":"tags"},{"content":"\"That's simultaneously the sweetest and the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a very long time, Anna-Lena.\"\nFredrik Backman’s debut novel, A Man Called Ove, is a bittersweet depiction of a lonely old man as he tries to come to terms with a world that's changing around him. The emotional moments worked great, but the humor–while generally effective–seemed forced at times.\u0026nbsp;\nAnxious People, Backman’s ninth novel, is, as the title clues us in, about anxious people. Or as a third person narrator often addresses them, idiots. “This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots.” A parent is anxious not to repeat their own parent’s mistakes, while spiraling down a path of no return. Another parent, having lost their spouse to death and daughter to drugs, is anxious about their son’s success. The son, in turn, is anxious about helping people. A person he helps grows up with the typical anxieties of Gen Z : global warming, animal preservation, the widening gap between the rich and the poor. A pregnant woman worries about the impracticality of her partner. An older woman stresses about her husband’s sense of self worth. These and other anxieties intertwine and culminate in a botched bank robbery and the unlikeliest of hostage situations.\nRevealing anything more at all about Anxious People would be a disservice to the author, who couches every significant piece of information in a mystery and reveals them slowly. Sometimes infuriatingly so. As in A Man Called Ove, Fredrik Backman’s writing (ably aided by the translator Neil Smith) switches between being humorous and tugging your emotions. However, the problems I personally had in A Man Called Ove are present in Anxious People as well, and if anything, they are amplified. Both novels occasionally compromise consistency for the sake of humor. The interrogation scenes in Anxious People stick out as an example. A significant amount of suspension of disbelief is required to stomach some of the interactions between cops and witnesses in Anxious People. One of Backman’s favorite targets for mockery is the lifestyle of young people obsessed with social media. “Hand on heart, which of us hasn't wanted to pull a gun after talking to a twenty-year-old?”, he remarks. The forced humor is one of my biggest gripes with Anxious People.\u0026nbsp;\nA smaller problem is that the writing is manipulative, but we realize that we are manipulated by an excellent craftsman. Art is manipulation, after all, and the level of subtlety one desires is subjective. Backman regularly uses misdirection and pulls the rug under our feet, and thereby controls the emotional flow. However, unlike in A Man Called Ove, the characters are not as well sketched out. We learn that a police officer is competent through another character who tells him. We learn that a man is not as bad as he seems when his wife explains why. We learn that a seemingly antisocial woman is concerned about everyday people, when she tells us so. A character called Roger resembles Ove. We initially see him as an older person with rigid views, until we learn that there is more to the man. But the subconscious association with Backman’s earlier work has more of a role to play in us sympathizing with Roger than anything he does in Anxious People.\nDespite the faults, Anxious People resonates in parts. It deals with topics such as parenting, suicide, mental health, the destructive impact of modern financial systems on individuals, marriage, love and divorce. And loneliness. “I buy distance from other people… The most expensive things you can buy in the most densely populated places on the planet is distance”, remarks a character. Drug abuse is another topic Backman manages to deal with effectively. The narrator, who seems to be telling us often what the story is about, eventually offers what is probably the most accurate description of Anxious People : “Perhaps this is a story about a bridge”. Multiple inciting events in the story happen around a physical bridge. Anxious People is also about bridging the gap between people and overcoming our biases to look past people who we perceive as idiots. “Sometimes two strangers need only one thing in common to find each other sympathetic.”\u0026nbsp;\nDespite some of its flaws, Anxious People is an engaging read. As a character remarks in my opening quote, Anxious People oscillates between sweetness and ridiculousness. Fredrik Backman is a master of crafting bittersweet moments and depending on where you are in life, you might enjoy it. After all, “... people need fairy tales as well, not just narrative\".\u0026nbsp; ","date":"18 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fredrik-backmans-anxious-people/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Fredrik Backman's Anxious People","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"18 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Review","type":"tags"},{"content":"You'll pretend you were men instead of babies, and you'll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men. And war will look just wonderful, so we'll have a lot more of them. And they'll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs.\n\"If I hadn't spent so much time studying Earthlings,\" said the Tralfamadorian, “I wouldn't have any idea what was meant by ‘free will.’ I’ve visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.\"Before I started reading Slaughterhouse-Five, I assumed that Kurt Vonnegut was primarily a fantasy writer. My misconception was probably from conflating Vonnegut with Brandon Sanderson, the extremely popular fantasy writer who is all the rage today, given that both these authors have resources on writing available for free online. But while I have continued to hear high praise for Vonnegut, Sanderson’s work seems to be more polarizing. Naturally, I attempted to read Vonnegut first.\u0026nbsp;\nSlaughterhouse-Five could be categorized as a fantasy novel. It incorporates concepts such as alien abduction and time-travel without attempting to dive into “scienc-y” explanations. However, it is mainly a brutally honest and darkly humorous anti-war novel that also doubles down as a cultural critic. The fact that Vonnegut achieves all this in 200-odd pages that read crisply is a testament to his abilities as a writer.\u0026nbsp;\nClassified as a postmodern novel, Slaughterhouse-Five's first lines are “All these happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.” The novel begins with a first person narrator who resembles the author so much that we are not sure what’s real and what’s not. Kurt Vonnegut was a Second World War veteran who was a prisoner of war in Dresden when the allied forces bombed the city, razing it to the ground and killing about 25000 people. The narrator describes his meandering attempt to write a book. After all, “there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre”. He ultimately pens something down, thereby shifting the perspective to the third person and tracking his protagonist, Billy Pilgrim. Billy is successful in his personal life, but a misfit in war. At some point during the war, Billy is captured by “Tralfamadorians”, an alien race that see time as a fourth dimension, meaning that they can see the past, present and the future simultaneously. Billy acquires this ability as well. He is “unstuck in time”. This accounts for the criss-crossing non-linear narrative.\u0026nbsp;\nAll American army men are portrayed unsympathetically--most of them are either bumbling fools or psychopaths. Even today, such an unsentimental portrayal of a country’s armed forces would attract controversy. In fact, Wilson County in Tennessee banned 400 books just two months back, including Slaughterhouse-Five. In 1972, a circuit judge in Michigan called the book “depraved, immoral, psychotic, vulgar, and anti-Christian.” The author's biggest achievement is his compelling first-hand account of this dreary side of war. But he also has things to say about the traditional American lifestyle. As a character in this book remarks, “Americans are urged to hate themselves.. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor.”\u0026nbsp;\nSlaughterhouse-Five has a litany of characters, but none of the characters undergo a transformational arc. As the narrator remarks, “There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because just of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters.” Even so, we meet a lot of characters, many of them recurring from Vonnegut’s other novels. The narrator breaks the third-person narrative at times as well, with lines such as “That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.” This reminded me of the Indian epic Mahabharata, which has the author Vyasa making appearances through the story - though Vonnegut is a cog in the machinery and not an all-knowing and powerful sage.\nThe underlying theme of Slaughterhouse-Five is fatalism and denial of causality. The phrase “So it goes” recurs multiple times through the novel (apparently 106 times), signifying a resigned acceptance of the vicissitudes of fate. A dialogue between Billy and a Tralfamadorian goes like this when Billy asks why he was the person singled out to be abducted by them: \"Have you seen bugs trapped in amber?\"\u0026nbsp;\n\"Yes.” Billy, in fact, had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three ladybugs embedded in it.\u0026nbsp;\n\"Well, here we are, Mr.Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this minute. There is no why.”\nI look forward to reading more by Kurt Vonnegut. Despite being based on the second World War, which seems to be an eternity away now, Vonnegut’s deglamorization of war and his social critique remain relevant. And his humor and wit make it all the more palatable.\n","date":"8 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/kurt-vonneguts-slaughterhouse-five/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five","type":"posts"},{"content":"A decade ago, I used to read more in terms of quantity and variety. I read far less now because of life and social media. Having recognized this, and hoping to correct for variety (while giving up on quantity), I decided to read some magazines. Short pieces on varied topics might help expand the breadth of what I read. On the way to the magazine section in the local public library, I stopped for a brief look in the non-fiction section, and I spotted Margaret Atwood’s Burning Questions - Essays and Occasional Pieces - 2004 to 2021. I have been aware of Atwood for a long time. The Handmaid’s Tale is, of course, extremely popular. But I have also encountered her name in other places, mostly through her reviews of other books that I have enjoyed. I had started reading The Handmaid’s Tale at some point of time, but I hadn’t completed it. But Atwood has been on my to-read list, and this was, I thought, as good an introduction into Atwood’s body of work as any.\nThat was a questionable assumption. For when you are already out of form on reading, attempting to get through nearly 450 pages of nonfiction is hard. More so if the book is a collection of smaller essays, requiring you to switch context multiple times. I am glad to report that I managed to get through this, and as I am wont to feel after finishing most books, I am happy that I did. The fact that through the nearly 15 years that these essays span, Atwood seems to have held consistent views with thematic commonalities helped a lot.\u0026nbsp;\nMargaret Atwood, as she often emphasizes, is old. In her lifetime, Atwood has seen the Western World undergo drastic changes and dramatic shifts. She was born in 1939, just as the second World War had begun. Atwood suggests that the post-world war era saw Western governments actively nudging women who had filled in career roles during the war back to their homes to make way for men returning from the war. This was followed by the second wave of feminism in the 60s, the hippie movement in the 70s, Cold War, the Reagan era, the Fukuyama’s false theory of the ‘end of history”, the rise of internet and social media, and the post-9/11 era. And after the historical American aberration that was the Obama presidency, we had the Trump era encompassing COVID, followed by what seemed like the end of the Trump era. Alas.\u0026nbsp;\nEven within the field of literature, it is astonishing to hear Atwood describe living along with some literary greats, and meeting some of them. Why was Simone de Beauvoir so frightening to me? Easy for you to ask: you have the benefit of distance–dead people are less innately scary than living ones, especially if they have been cut down to size by biographers, ever alert to flaws–whereas for me, Beauvoir was a giant contemporary\nshe says, in her introduction to the English translation of Simone de Beavoir’s Les Inseparables.\u0026nbsp;\nAtwood is multifaceted. She is a poet, a novelist, a dramatist, a children’s writer, a graphic novelist, and most significantly, a literary critic. Throughout Burning Questions, her voracious conception of works from the Western literature stands out. A lot of essays in Burning Questions take the form of book introductions, book reviews, and author biographies. Of these, Richard Power’s Echo Maker is probably the only work that I have read, but I still found her analysis of books to be engaging. Some broader literary pieces include her thoughts on what makes a novel a novel, and her distinction between what she calls 'speculative fiction', 'science fiction' and 'fantasy'. Even broader is her contemplation on the significance of art and artists. Atwood’s father was an entomologist, and a significant part of her childhood was spent in the backwoods of Ottawa. This must have been a big influence on her lifelong interest in science and nature, and a lot of the pieces strongly reflect her sense of preservation of nature and scientific literacy. Atwood’s writing style is generally witty, and this helps us understand her as a person.\u0026nbsp;\nAtwood refers to the impact of Rachel Carson whose Silent Spring (1962) drew attention to the harmful effects of pesticides much before it was in vogue. Apart from Simone de Beavoir, she also writes about the influence of authors like Alice Munro, Kafka, and Shakespeare. Her later essays focus on the rise of authoritarianism and in “Am I a Bad feminist”, she defends her position against mob justice and for transparency.\nAs I read Burning Questions, I was filled with a touch of regret at not (yet) having read Atwood’s novels, and not having explored authors such as Alice Munro and Ursula Le Guin. But inspiration works by highlighting what one is lacking in life and motivating one to attempt to strive for them. After all, there is still time. Burning Questions is an inspiring and enlightening read.\n","date":"24 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/margaret-atwoods-burning-questions/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Margaret Atwood's Burning Questions","type":"posts"},{"content":"\nWe are already into the new year, but I did not want to give up on what has now become my little routine - a summary of all the books I read in the previous year. In 2021, I had written about momentous changes to my life that left me little time for reading. The impact of those very positive changes continued, so much so that my only aim going into 2022 was to just continue reading, regardless of quantity. I managed to read 13 books. So while other readers (hello, Mr. Obama) spend time picking and organizing their favorite reads of the year, here are my brief thoughts on every single book I read in 2022.\nI started the year with Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. This classic American play is a seething critic of American capitalism and toxic positivity, but like any great story, this commentary revolves around an emotional core -- in this case caused by a conflict between a father and a son, both betraying each other in some ways. Despite it being written in 1949, I feel Death of a Salesman is relevant today, so much so that I compared the lead character Willy Lomar to Donald Trump in my review from earlier in the year.\u0026nbsp;\nI came across Octavia Butler's name in a New Yorker article a couple of years back, and when I heard her name mentioned a second time in a book discussion forum, I was convinced I was missing out on something great. I picked up Parable of the Sower, the first of her abandoned Earthseed series, and was bowled over by the dystopian novel with an unusual protagonist, Lauren Olamina, who suffers from a condition called hyperempathy disorder. Written in 1993, Octavia Butler imagines America in 2024: a lawless region where climate change and severe wealth inequality causes an existence where violence is a way of life. Despite living in a walled community, Olamina senses that their safety is only temporary. When her predictions come through destroying her community, she is forced to lead a group of like-minded individuals on a dangerous quest. Serving as a backdrop is growing religious authoritarianism, with a popular right wing Presidential candidate spewing slogans such as \"Make America Great Again!\". Such was the clairvoyance of Octavia Butler.\nMy third read was a book I had no clue about before I picked it up. An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears was suggested by a librarian because I love Umberto Eco's novels. I struggled through this almost 700 page historical fiction and regretted picking it up for about half the book. But by the time I got through it, I was really glad that I had persisted. The setting for Iain Pears's Magnum Opus is late 17th century England, which is a happening place, to say the least. The Cromwell era -- which started with a civil war and the execution of King Charles, followed by the abdication of Cromwell and reinstatement of King Charles II a few years later -- has just ended. It is also the beginning of the shift of Scientific renaissance from the rest of Europe to England, thanks to the presence of the likes of Issac Newton and Robert Boyle. Most significantly, there is intense religious strife, as Catholics, Royalists, Protestants are at proxy war with each other, while extreme puritans escape to the Americas. Iain Pears narrates a tale with 4 unreliable narrators. But at the center of all their narcissistic narratives is a young mystical woman called Sarah Blundy. For a long while, we feel that the narrative structure does not do enough justice to this wonderful character. However, things fall in place magnificently as we race towards the end.\nI followed this up with Sidney Lumet's Making Movies. Sidney Lumet is best known for directing 12 Angry Men, but he was a prolific director working successfully across different genres. In Making Movies, Sidney Lumet breaks down the different aspects that go into making a movie in an extremely accessible style. Unfortunately, I had not watched a lot of Lumet's movies going into the book. Regardless, this was a succinctly written book that made me realize the many considerations and decisions that go into making a movie. I was blown over with Lumet’s description of the lensing techniques he used in 12 Angry Men to create an effect of claustrophobia as the jury's debates progressively gets more heated. Here is a useful visual description someone created on YouTube based on Lumet’s description. I have copious notes from this book, but I will revisit the book after watching a few more of Lumet's movies.\nMy next read was Frederik Backman's A Man Called Ove. An English movie adaptation of this book called A Man Called Otto starring Tom Hanks just released in the U.S., and there is already an acclaimed Swedish movie adaptation. After all, A Man Called Ove is perfect for movie adaptations - it is emotionally poignant and makes you smile and shed some tears. Frederik Backman's writing is lyrical and funny, and he sketches out some very well drawn emotional moments. I wrote a review of this book when I read it, but watching the original Swedish movie adaptation now, I feel I was a little too harsh on the book.\u0026nbsp;\nReturning to tough books that take forever to get through, I read A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess.\u0026nbsp; It's been more than a decade now since I first watched Kubrik's acclaimed film adaptation, and I remember watching the first few scenes of the movie with horror. The payback was in the form of thought provoking questions the movie made me consider, forcing me to realize Kubrick's greatness as a filmmaker. Anthony Burgess's novella is a completely different beast. With most of the dialogues written in an invented dialect, The Clockwork Orange is not for the faint hearted. I wrote a lot more about Anthony Burgess's Pelagian beliefs and his own thoughts on the movie adaptation in my review.\nMy next book was a non-fiction - bell hooks' (lack of capitalization as per author’s preference) Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism. My first attempt reading an academic feminist text was enlightening. bell hooks' core argument is that black women face oppression through multiple avenues - from white men, white women and black men. This is essentially the concept of intersectionality, though the word was not in use when bell hooks published this book. My biggest lesson from this book was that when someone co-opts a well meaning word -- as white women did with the word feminism – a good approach is to reclaim the word instead of turning against the word. After all, feminism is a fight for equality (or even better, equity), and feminists, by definition, stand against all forms of oppression. More thoughts on this book are in my review.\nMy next read was probably my best of the year. In Homeland Elegies by Ayad Akhtar, I discovered a modern day great. I see a trend in many mainstream books critical of some aspects of America where authors, to some extent, couch their criticism in American exceptionalism. As a Muslim author writing about America, Akhtar does away with these formalities. The only concession he makes is in an overture, where he writes: \"Every atom of this blood formed of this soil, this air\". Once he claims the freedom of expression supposedly granted to all Americans, Akhtar allows himself to freely critique the American society, the Muslim community within American society, and his ancestral family back in Pakistan who wax eloquent about the western destruction of “culture”. But which Akhtar is the narrator? For the author choses a genre called Autofiction - a mix of autobiography and fiction. Hence, when Akhtar (the narrator) describes his father as a doctor specializing in a unique heart condition and Donald Trump meeting him for a consultation, I spent a few minutes Googling before realizing that this was the fiction in the auto-fiction. Ayad Akhtar's novel is intellectual, without being off-putting. Sample this sentence where the author compares his father’s gambling addiction and his slow disillusionment with Donald Trump starting from a place of glorification\nFather's enthrallment with candidate Trump, first nascent, then ascendent, then euphoric, then disappointed, then betrayed and confused, and finally exhausted, a gamut of intensities whose order and range are proper to the ambit of all addiction- yes, a granular account of Father's addiction, his ceaselessly shifting emotions, his evasions and avowals and disavowals, the steady shedding of his civility, the daily obsession, the ad hoc rationalizations–all this might get of value to note, to show, and, in the process, through this unlikeliest of American Muslim lenses, to reveal the full extent of the terrifying lust for unreality that has engulfed us all.\nThere were some parts of Homeland Elegies that did not work for me. But then, I wonder if it was due to the the limited perspective of the narrator the author choses, rather than that of the author himself.\nThe next book I read was for a Diversity, Inclusion and Equity book club. It was \"Everything You Wanted to Know About Indians But Were Afraid to Ask: Young Readers Edition\" by Anton Treuer. Unfortunately, I was sent the young readers edition, and ended up reading what I assume was a filtered version of answers to many questions that one might have about native American history, languages, culture and issues.\u0026nbsp; Nevertheless, this was a great introduction to a topic that I need to explore more.\nI followed this with The Way Things Were by Aatish Taseer. The title of the book is a translation of the Sanskrit word \"Itihasa\", which is a mix of \"talk, legend, tradition, history\". The protagonist, following the footsteps of his father, is a Sanskrit scholar. The Way Things Were deals with the tensions of an India breaking away from socialism to embrace liberalism, and the dangers of authoritarianism. The historical setting covers the imposition of Emergency by Indira Gandhi; her assassination and the subsequent Sikh riots; and ends with the demolition of Babri Masjid - a fingerpost indicating the growth of Hindu nationalism. The core conflict is a son accepting and understanding his father, but there is also the conflict of a scholarly pursuit of Sanskrit and the history of India as opposed to a more reactionary pursuit that attempts to fit history in a pre-formed narrative. At the center of the later conflict is a \"man without an agenda, without a tribe. A man willing to let history be what it was, without wanting to ram it into a frame which answered the needs of a particular group or faith or caste.\" I was at an extremely busy phase of my life when I read The Way Things Were, and I took way too long to complete it. However, that does not absolve the book of its problems - the repetitive parties and conversations where different characters take turns putting forth the author's view, and the amateur romance. Like with most books I read, I did feel satisfied with the ending. But I am not very sure if I would recommend this.\nThe next two books I read were Honesty for Sale by Koushik K R and How to Tell Stories and Other Essays by Mark Twain.The former was written by someone I met in social media and I wanted to give it a try. It was a very good attempt at a novel aimed to be made as a movie - think Shankar meets Michael Crichton meets The Family Man. The plot is fast paced, but the writing is inconsistent. The latter was a small book that did not hold much context for me and I wouldn't have continued it if it were not extremely tiny.\nI finished the year with another non-fiction - Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire by Alex von Tunzelmann. This fast paced book deals with the end of the British empire in India with a focus on Lord Mountbatten, Edwina Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru. Tunzelmann choses to highlight the drama between people, and argues that personal rivalries and romances played an oversized role in the hasty withdrawal of the British, and the chaos that followed in India and Pakistan. While other historians may debate this, it is definitely an interesting perspective. Tunzelmann has great wit and humor, and aims most of her acerbic lines at Lord Mountbatten - who is shown as a bumbling Administrator with a penchant only for branding and showmanship. On the other hand, Edwina Mountbatten is depicted with immense respect. The relationship between Mountbatten and Edwina, and the more consequential relationship between Nehru and Edwina, are the core of this book. Indian Summer is a very entertaining read. I, for one, was extremely surprised to learn that Lord Mountbatten and Edwina Mountbatten acted in a short film directed by Charlie Chaplin. Enjoy the movie here.\nEnding 2022, I feel like I did not have a lot of agency in what I read. I could pretend that this was the reason I did not read as much this year, but to be honest, life got in the way. For 2023, I hope to be more deliberate in what I read.\nWish you all a very happy new year!\n","date":"3 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-2022-in-books/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My 2022 in books","type":"posts"},{"content":"Less than a year after my arrival to the U.S.A, and soon after the inauguration of the country’s\u0026nbsp; 45th President, hundreds of thousands of women decided to send a message to the new administration. In what was dubbed the “pussyhat” riots, women across the country marched wearing pink pussy-hats in an attempt to demonstrate solidarity against the President who had confessed on tape to grabbing women by their pussies. I was, as always, in the thick of things – by which I mean I was comfortably sitting at home scrolling ardently through social media trying to catch the most widely shared clicks, clips and bytes. One particular YouTube video caught my eye, and has stayed with me since. In this video, a black man confronts some of the protesting women, and questions their knowledge of the history of the feminist movement in the U.S.A. Scrolling through the comments on the video, I grasped, based on the authority of YouTube commenters,\u0026nbsp; that the\u0026nbsp; women's suffrage movement, a.k.a., the first wave of feminism in the U.S.A, was tainted with racism.\u0026nbsp;\nWords and phrases are pliable. Since they work by association, concerted efforts to link a word or a phrase to a certain connotation are often successful in drawing unwarranted reactions against it. Take “political-correctness”, for instance. Taken by itself, it is a meaningless phrase. However, the rightwing ecosystem in the U.S.\u0026nbsp; has so successfully associated a\u0026nbsp; disagreeable meaning to the term that supporters of fascists across the World use the term. “He\", for it is usually a he, \"says\u0026nbsp; it like it is, and that’s why we like him.”. Does he really? Will he still say it if it is politically inconvenient for him? If it is so politically incorrect, why did so many people support him despite saying it? What about all those times when he demonstrably lied? Try asking such questions and you will be met with circular reasoning. “Feminism” is another such word. By the use of convenient straw(wo)man arguments, the word has been sullied so much that some people disown the word, despite finding nothing disagreeable with what feminism actually entails.\nBell Hooks was an 18-year old right in the middle of the second wave of feminist movement in the U.S.A. when she started writing “ain’t i a woman? black women and feminism”. She would eventually publish it ten years later.\u0026nbsp; The effort spanned a time when African-American women were skeptical of feminism which was largely spearheaded by white women and represented their concerns. The civil rights movement was in the recent past, and racial identity took precedence over gender identity for many African-American women. Bell Hooks argues that sexism and patriarchy are as harmful, if not more, than racism. “Every women’s movement in America from its earliest origin to the present day has been built on a racist foundation— a fact which in no way invalidates feminism as a political ideology”, she concedes. But faced with a word tainted by association with racism, she does not forego the word. And in that spirit, this book is both a criticism of the feminist movements and a defense of it as a political ideology that needs to be reclaimed. Hooks calls attention to the struggle of being at the intersection of two marginalized groups : “When black people are talked about the focus tends to be on black men; and when women are talked about the focus tends to be on white women.” Though I had\u0026nbsp; understood the modern term “intersectionality” in general terms, Ain’t I a Woman is my first scholarly introduction to the concept.\u0026nbsp;\nThe title of the book is borrowed from Sojourner Truth’s powerful speech of the same title in the 1851 Ohio Women’s Convention. Apparently, recent consensus by historians is that the speech was not delivered in the context and not with the words it has been believed to be. But there is definitely a folklorish impact in the words quoted by Bell Hooks. Hooks starts by describing the treatment of black women in slavery, and argues that they were treated worse than black men. She also theorizes on the complex dynamics between white women and black women in a slave household.\nIt was hard for me to read this book, mostly due to my unfamiliarity with the feminist moment, and more broadly, the history of the U.S.A. This was further complicated by the fact that this is a theoretical book. Bell Hooks rigorously inspects speeches and writings from a wide variety of personalities and finds aspects in them that highlight either a patriarchal or a racist mindset. On one hand, she questions popular feminist literature and surveys of women as focussing solely on white women. “While it is in no way racist for any author to write a book exclusively about white women, it is fundamentally racist for books to be published that focus solely on the American white woman’s experience in which that experience is assumed to be the American woman’s experience”, she points out, and adds that a survey focussing on black women, on the other hand, needs to be qualified as such. Bell Hooks also makes a very relevant argument that applies to privileged people across the World : “In a racially imperialist nation such as ours, it is the dominant race that reserves for itself the luxury of dismissing racial identity while the oppressed race is made daily aware of their racial identity. It is the dominant race that can make it seem that their experience is representative”.\nOn the other hand, Bell Hooks also points out the sexism within the black community and propagated by its leaders. Starting with Frederik Douglas who, despite his support for women’s suffrage, prioritized voting rights for black people. Implicit in this is the exclusion of black women’s vote. Hooks is more severe on Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Elijah Mohammed and the black power leaders. In this vein, Hooks writes extensively about black male sexism that discourages, among many other things, black women being friendly with white men. Many of these leaders felt having a white female partner, on the flip side, as dominating the white male.\nThe author makes more interesting observations. For instance, when white women started demanding equal working opportunities, they ignored the fact that black women had been working for long – first as slaves, and then as breadwinners for their families. The fact that black women earned, often in lieu of black men, led to scholarly articles on the \"emasculation\"\u0026nbsp; of black men by their women, and the \"matriarchal\" setup of African-American families.\u0026nbsp;Hooks contends that though both these assumptions were readily accepted even within the black community, they were harmful.\nain’t i a woman? black women and feminism is an extensive book that covers a lot of aspects of American culture. Bell Hooks is severe on the very foundations of American ideals - imperialism, racism, sexism and even capitalism. On the desire to find meaningful work, she says “For a few lucky men, for far fewer women, work has occasionally been a source of meaning and creativity. But for most of the rest it remains even now forced drudgery in front of the ploughs, machines, words or numbers—pushing products, pushing switches, pushing papers to eke out the wherewithal of material existence.” Personally, this book was my first step in understanding intersectionality and feminism. I have a lot more to read and learn, starting with Hooks’s other works.\n","date":"26 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-aint-i-a-woman-black-women-and-feminism-by-bell-hooks/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of ain’t i a woman? black women and feminism by Bell Hooks","type":"posts"},{"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n\"It may not be nice to be good, little 6655321. It may be horrible to be good.. What does God want? Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?.. And yet, in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of an ability to make an ethical choice, you have in a sense really chosen the good. \"\nI woke up early this morning hoping to force myself to write a review of The Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. After all, I started this year resolving to pen my thoughts about every book I read, and have struggled to write coherently ever since. Having a mobile phone at an arm’s length does not help, and true to form, I started browsing “a bit” for “distraction”. This morning's content of choice was a set of videos posted by a documentary filmmaker who, along with his wife, was taunting a masked group of the white supremacist and neo-Nazi Patriot Front marching in and around Boston yesterday. One could even say that the documentary filmmaker was deliberately trying to provoke the group, testing the limits of his free speech in a way. The videos distil why it is difficult to read and review Anthony Burgess’s 1962 classic in the present day and age. Today’s date is not without significance as well. It is 4th of July in the United States, a day commemorating the country’s declaration of independence. It is as good an occasion as any to attempt to pen one’s thoughts on Burgess’s thought-provoking study on free will and determinism.\nMy introduction to The Clockwork Orange, like that of most people, was through Stanley Kubrick’s movie adaptation. In fact, The Clockwork Orange was the movie that made me take notice of Kubrick as a director. The 1986 America edition that I read has an introduction by Burgess where he rues the fact that his literary oeuvre is represented by, and often only by, The Clockwork Orange, thanks to Kubrick. Burgess has plenty to say on the movie adaptation, but he calls the book itself “too didactic to be artistic”, since “the moral lesson in this book sticks out like a sore thumb”. The heart of his discontent is the 21st chapter. As a prolific music composer, Anthony Burgess structures The Clockwork Orange as 3 sections of 7 chapters each. When initially published in the USA in 1962, the publisher insisted on publishing the book without the final chapter (the chapter was reintroduced a quarter century later). Stanley Kubrick based his screenplay on the American version of the book, and did not see the point of the 21st chapter even though he became aware of it before filming his movie. So, what’s it about the 21st chapter, apart from structural integrity, that is so polarizing? In Burgess’s view, the 21st chapter is the “denou-ment” that turns the novel from being “a fable” or “an allegory” into a genuine fiction. This is because, Burgess believes, fiction as a work of art needs a character transformation. The American publisher, on the other hand, believed that the original ending was\u0026nbsp; “bland and it showed a Pelagian unwillingness to accept that a human being could be a model of unregenerable evil”. \"My book was Kennedyan and accepted the notion of moral progress. What was really wanted was a Nixonian book with no shred of optimism in it\", Burgess remarks. Notice the reference to Richard Nixon, which is not insignificant.\nBurgess is, hence, an author of the classic bend. He derives his morality from a formerly heretical sect(s) of Christianity in the 5th century A.D. – Pelagianism – encompassing a set of beliefs that did not accept the idea of “original sin”. Man does not inherit the sin of Adam simply because one can only be held accountable for their own sins. One can be good, or evil, and has the complete free will to choose between the two. This is the central theme of The Clockwork Orange. Should mechanistic morality be imposed on a creature oozing juice and sweetness?\u0026nbsp;\nThe second regret Burgess has is his use of the Nadsat language – Anthony Burgess’s own creation of a slang language that borrows heavily from Caucasian languages, with a mix of cockney colloquial words and school boyish rhyming phrases. The novel is a first person narrative by Alex, the fifteen year old protagonist, and Alex’s use of the slang permeates the book. Some people just read through until they get used to the language, while others give up on the book. I, on the other rooker, my brothers, skorrily ittied to a dictionary whenever I viddied a new slovo. This, of course, hindered the pace of my already slow reading.\nThe Clockwork Orange begins with Alex, the fifteen year old narrator, who is enjoying a Milk Plus – milk plus any drug of your choice – with his friends at the Korova Milk Bar (pictured by Kubrick later through a memorable zoom out shot). Alex is the youngest, but the most cunning member and the de facto leader of the gang. Soon we see that Alex’s life outside his school is one of “ultra-violence” : rape, thievery, and violence just for the sake of it. When caught, he volunteers for a novel reformative treatment introduced by the new Government - Ludovico’s technique. A form of behavioral conditioning, this technique attempts to create a subconscious association between violence, music and nauseating symptoms. However, is such a treatment moral? And will it be effective? This is not an easy book to read, thanks to its invented language. The violence could also be a turn-off for many readers. The Clockwork Orange is a novel of ideas set in a dystopian setting and following the tradition of Huxley's The Brave New World. However, I found Burgess’s work to be much more enjoyable thanks to the wit of the protagonist, Alex. Alex is also self-aware to an extent. At one point, he goes into this rumination explaining his actions :\u0026nbsp; \"But, brothers, this biting over their toe-nails over what is the cause of badness is what turns me into a fine laughing malchick. They don't go into what is the cause of goodness, so why the other shop? ... More, badness is of the self, the one, the you or me on our oddly knockies, and that self is made by old Bog or God and is his great pride and radosty. But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self. And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?”. He sums this up simply as “what I do I do because I like to do.\"\u0026nbsp;\nIn short, Burgess’s protagonist is an amoral creature caught in a fictional work of the classic bend. No wonder then that the final chapter seems sudden and forced. Burgess is clever enough to connect the fact that Americans loved the nihilistic 20-chapter novel and its movie adaptation with the rise of Richard Nixon. And reading this book today is jarring, knowing that the rise of Nixon set the stage for the current rise of Donald Trump, and with him, the neo-Nazis of the U.S.A. It is probably only me, but Alex’s use of endearments like “my brothers” and his tendency to refer to himself as “Your Humble Narrator” constantly reminded me of Trump, and his self-referential “your favorite President”. As if that’s not enough, Alex seems to obsess over cleanliness while Trump is reportedly a germaphobe. Unfortunately, reality more often follows the structure of an allegory than the structure of fiction. Nevertheless, The Clockwork Orange is worth a read.\n","date":"4 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-anthony-burgesss-a-clockwork-orange/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange","type":"posts"},{"content":"\n\u0026nbsp;“For the greatest fear of death is that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.”\nDealing with a subject that is charming and humorous on the surface, but layered with serious emotions underneath, is a tightrope walk. Only some creators manage to achieve success in such an endeavor. Markus Zusak's The Book Thief and Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful come to mind. Fredrik Backman attempts to walk this tightrope in his A Man Called Ove.\nA Man Called Ove starts with a Swedish man called Ove attempting to purchase an Apple iPad. The problem? Ove hates anything with a semblance of modernity and believes that the world is out to fool him – after all, why sell such an expensive \"computer\", especially one without a keyboard? There is comedy potential here and Backman milks it. As we discover more about Ove, we realise that he is – to use a phrase that Backman keeps repeating – a specific “sort of man”. For instance, Ove is “the sort of man who checks the status of all things by giving them a good kick\". He is a functional man, understanding only things he could feel and touch, and taking pride in always being right. A Man Called Ove paints the portrayal of a man who is, on one hand, a geriatric vigilante enforcing rules in his own small – and often ineffective – way; and on the other, someone who would prompt the remark “OK, Boomer!”\nWe get the first sign that Ove is not just what we see on the surface at a graveyard, when he remarks \"It's not natural rattling around the house on my own all day when you're not here. It's no way to live. That's all I have to say\"\u0026nbsp; to his wife’s tombstone. Backman intercuts between the past and the present. It is in the flashback that we meet some of the novel’s more interesting characters. Ove’s wife Sonja and his father stand out. The latter is portrayed as an honest, simple, hardworking and efficient man whose principles define, to a large extent, Ove’s life. Sonja is everything that Ove is not - artistic, ebullient, abstract, and friendly. She is “a woman who insisted on seeing more potential in certain men than they saw in themselves”. Her pairing with Ove is unlikely, because\u0026nbsp; “people said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.” In the present, however, Ove seems different, and difficult. He has been forced into retirement and encounters an Iranian neighbor and her bungling husband, an overweight neighbor (whose weight is emphasized too often), a teenager in love, kids who are too friendly for his taste, and a stray cat. A Man Called Ove sketches the journey of a rare kind of person who wants a simple structured life; who encounters multiple incidents of grief that isolate him; and who ultimately squeezes out the inherent good in him to help his neighbors.\nRichard Backman’s writing is lyrical, and he uses his metaphors well. He compares a woman’s laughter to a carbonated drink poured too fast and bubbling in all directions. Ove’s rudeness allows Backman to be mean too, as he compares an overweight man’s tummy to a “big mound of ice cream that's first been melted and then been refrozen”, or describes another person as “his hair looks as if someone saved him from drowning in a barrel by pulling him up by his locks\". Ove is a misfit who is “caught in a wrong time”, “want(s) only few things from life” and he has a “sense of pride in taking control” and “in being right.” As everything that gave him joy or comfort is taken away from him, Ove is grief stricken. Hence, he views modern society through a harsh lens. After all, many of us work from home, do not have much to show tangibly after a day’s work, and are at a loss when we need to do physical things with our hands. We drive cars with automatic gears, and consider things to be replaceable. We are not self-sufficient. One could definitely sympathize with a person from a different era feeling at odds with our lifestyles.\nHowever, at times it feels like Backman’s critique of the society does not fully fit Ove’s perspective in which it is delivered. The older Ove does not behave in a way that the younger Ove does. Some of these inconsistencies can be explained away as a reaction to the multiple scars in Ove’s life. But I still had the distinct feeling that the author has compromised character consistency to add humor. Moreover, there are multiple characters that fit a similar mold - at some level, Ove, his father, his father-in-law, and Rune would enjoy, as much as these men can enjoy, a silent meal together. And finally, the third act of the story is sudden and rushed. We even get a villain, a representative of bureaucracy that belongs in a more Kafka-esque novel. Of course, Backman shows self-awareness here, ending this character with the following sentances : “He goes around the corner and disappears the way shadows do when the sun reaches its apex in the sky. Or like villains at the end of stories.\"\nBackman is going for a feel-good and charming vibe with A Man Called Ove, and he largely succeeds. We encounter some wonderful moments Ove has with his father and his wife. The humor works as well, to an extent. However, I feel that\u0026nbsp; in an attempt to make this poignant book funny, Backman loses out on a smooth character graph for his titular protogonist.

But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid… A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man\"\n–Linda Loman\nI did not want to begin my thoughts on the brilliant contemporary classical play The Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller with a controversial opening line that causes people who have already read the play to squirm, while leading people who haven't read it to form an incorrect impression of the play, so I made the said sentence the subsequent line. The protagonist of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, Willy Lomar, constantly reminds me of Donald Trump. Take away the vileness from Trump, erase his unlikely success, peel away his knack for evading consequences, and discount his unearned money -- made through inheritance, con and grift – what you have is a Salesman who is a mass of contradictions, but propels himself through his strong beliefs, regardless of their veracity.\nThe Death of a Salesman works on two levels - as a portrayal of a capitalistic society that overvalues success of a narrow definition; and as a relationship drama of a flawed father and son duo who drift apart in values, but are held together by a taut, thin thread of love burdened by betrayal. Arthur Miller masterfully interweaves the two, resulting in a searing indictment of pernicious aspects of the society. America relies heavily on a culture of toxic positivity, with politicians constantly referring to its greatness and alleged exceptionalism with phrases such as “this is America!” even as close to a million people die of a pandemic. Willy Loman, an ageing salesman, represents this mindset of positivity and hope, his personal motto being “because the man who makes an appearance in the business world, the man who creates personal interest, is the man who gets ahead. Be liked and you will never want.\" The Death of a Salesman is, at its purest form, a description of the last day of Willy’s life, as he grapples with the betrayal of society, his own betrayal of his family, and in turn, the betrayal of his sons.\nMiller’s characterization is top-notch, and his narrative structure shifts seamlessly between the present and an idyllic past, between reality and imagination, and between rationality and schizophrenia. Willy Lomar's monologues and dialogues constantly shift between self-doubt (“They seem to laugh at me”) and confidence (“I’m well liked”) in a single breath. His elder son, Biff, turns from being a promising and charismatic athletic adolescent with a bright future to a kleptomaniac adult filled with self-doubt : \"I don't know--what I'm supposed to want\". The second son, ironically named Happy, is a shallower version of his father, with his ambitions being summed up as \"My own apartment, a car, and plenty of women\" and \"I got to show some of those pompous, self-important executives over there that Hap Loman can make the grade.\" The glue that holds together this family is the mother, Linda. She balances reality and day-to–day affairs with hopes and dreams, and plays along with Willy’s vision for a better future, leading one of her sons to remark \"What a woman! They broke the mold when they made her.\" My favorite is the next-door neighbor Charley, who acts as a counterfoil, and a more hopeful vision of America. He gets to deliver some of the wisest lines such as “The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell. And the funny thing is that you're a salesman, and you don't know that” and “My salvation is that I never took any interest in anything.\"\nThe Death of a Salesman is so vividly written that one can visualize the scenes playing out on a stage. The emotional beats are very effective; and as Willy Lomar desperately attempts to leave some legacy (\"I've got to get some seeds, right away. Nothing's planted. I don't have a thing in the ground.\"), one can not help but sympathize. The introduction by Christopher Bigsby is penetrating as well, and he sums up the mindset of Willy Lomar as \"When today fails to offer the justification for hope, tomorrow becomes the only grail worth pursuing.\" But what accentuates this play is the dynamic dialogue and the familial dynamics, with people bound together through love and hate; respect and “spite”; and hope and regret. If Willy Lomar were alive today, he would probably wholeheartedly believe a Trumpist pitch. But in another life, Willy may realize the validity of Biff’s observation when Biff says “Pop! I'm dime a dozen, and so are you!\". The Death of a Salesman is a highly recommended read.\n","date":"3 January 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-arthur-millers-death-of-a-salesman/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman","type":"posts"},{"content":"\u0026nbsp;\n2021 was a year of ennui. I discovered very late in the year that there is a medical condition that could potentially describe my state of mind through the year -\u0026nbsp;languishing. 2021 is also a year marking a momentous change in my life, a change that could affect my reading choices for the next few years. Given the circumstances, I am happy to have read any book at all this year. I read 17. Towards the end of the year, I took up a Quixotic project to review every book I read this year before New Years' Eve. I failed my deadline, but I still intend to try and write about many of these books in more detail. In the meantime, here are some quick thoughts on the books I read in 2021.\nI started the year with Pearl S. Buck's Kinfolk. This was my second Pearl S. Buck novel. Kinfolk did not meet my expectations that had been set by the first one I had read, but in its own way, it was a pretty decent read. \u0026nbsp;Kinfolk follows the Liang family as they grapple with the problems of being immigrants in America and of being outsiders back in China, as they try to settle back in their home country. Unfortunately the backdrop and the historical context is not as well drawn out as I would have liked. I wrote more about Kinfolk here.\nThe second book I read was Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis. Persepolis has been on my To-Be-Read (TBR) list for many, many years now and I finally got to it in 2021. Persepolis is a memoir of a teenage girl growing up in a tumultuous period in Iran -- the late 1970s and the early 1980s -- which witnessed a revolution, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, and a war. I liked Persepolis while simultaneously feeling that I would have liked it more if I had read it when I was younger. I wrote more about Satrapi's work here.\nI have been wanting to learn about stock markets for a while now. Unfortunately, I find this subject dry. I found a very helpful reddit post with a\u0026nbsp; list of resources to learn Value Investing, starting with some books. For 2021, I can say that I made an honest attempt, without much success. I started my journey with Joel Greenblatt's The Little Book That Meets the Market. Greenblatt targets adolescents, and starts with a very simplified example of how stocks and bonds work. He then proceeds to provide an algorithm, which he calls the \"magic formula\". This set of steps, if followed diligently, has been shown to beat the U.S. market and a couple of other markets in a few academic studies. Despite the loaded word magic, Greenblatt's formula has firm value investing foundations, which he goes on to explain in simplified terms. But his magic formula is not something I personally have the patience or diligence to try. I topped Greenblatt’s book\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp;Peter Lynch's Beating the Street and One Up on Wall Street. The former is more of a memoir of Peter Lynch's time managing the Magellan fund at Fidelity, one of the most consistently successful mutual funds on all times. The latter is a guide on picking stocks. Lynch has some strong opinions on investing in bonds and mutual funds, and details the criteria he uses to pick stocks. His thesis is that Wall Street fund managers are at a disadvantage compared to the laymen while picking stocks, and with discipline and curiosity, a layman can consistently beat the markets. Lynch punctuates his writing with some wry humor, a lot of which is mildly off-putting. Peter Lynch's larger point is well taken, but I do feel that sometimes he underestimates the power he had as a fund manager of a very popular mutual fund to gather information that you and I can't. A more diligent reader would take notes and make much out of Lynch's advice, but I realize now that I have not been able to put into practice most of Lynch's advice.\nI then moved back to fiction with Salman Rushdie's Quichotte. I had huge expectations for this novel set in the present day U.S.A. Rushdie chooses an ambitious narrative structure of a story within a story, with characters that are imagined, and imagine other characters. His writing is, as always, witty and stylish. However, instead of delving into the psyche of an everyday American, Rushdie dives into U.S. cable television listings. Quichotte entertains, but falls short of Rushdie's best. I wrote more about Quichotte here.\nIn \"My 2020 in books\", I had mentioned Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer - a terrific spy fiction thriller doubling down as a terse and piercing critique of the U.S.A. from the perspective of a Vietnamese-American. In one of the few promises I kept in 2021, I read The\u0026nbsp;Committed, Nguyen's follow-up to The Sympathizer. The Committed picks up right where The Sympathizer ended, in a boat packed with refugees escaping Vietnam - the so-called \"boat-people\". This time, the unnamed protagonist lands in France. This is primarily so that Nguyen can now focus his sharp observation skills on the French, a nation that first colonized Vietnam, but whose people now consider themselves sophisticated in comparison to the Americans. The focus also shifts from spy games to gangsterism, drugs and debauchery, as a Vietnamese gang gets in conflict with a Moroccan one. The Committed did not work for me as much as The Sympathizer did, but if Nguyen writes a follow in the next couple of years, I would definitely want to read it.\nI then read a couple of books for a diversity and inclusion book club at my organization. The first was This Is The Fire by Don Lemon. Don Lemon is a CNN commentator, and his prose is excellent as he writes about his experience of being black in contemporary America. Though Don Lemon's plea is compelling, I, without any skin in the game, feel a slight frustration that he does not go far enough. An American liberal needs to keep reminding us about the \"greatness\" of America to be mainstream. Coming from India, where the left is not bound to do so by nationalism, this is always surprising. My second diversity read was Isabel Wilkerson's magnum opus -\u0026nbsp;Caste : The Origins of our Discontents. Wilkerson draws parallels between racism in the U.S.A, casteism in India, and the Nuremberg laws under Nazi Germany. She documents multitudes of instances of injustice in the U.S.A., and proposes caste as an overarching term for any systematic discrimination. Isabel Wilkerson's prose is extremely engaging and she draws memorable metaphors, which make it easier to get through her meticulous documentation of oppression across continents. However, she does fall into the trap of oversimplifying India. It is hard not to.\nApart from books, I also discovered Clubhouse in 2021, and spent an insane amount of time in the voice-based social media app. Not all of it was useless. I offered to comment on a self-published short story collection of an aspiring screenwriter, self-translated from Tamil to English. Relay Race was short, and most of the characters were well-intentioned. The writing had a hint of humor that was lost in translation. The second book that I discovered though Clubhouse was fortuitous. The Great Hedge of India by Roy Moxham is an amazing book. It is part travelogue, part historical document, describing a barrier created by the British empire to prevent the smuggling of salt into the Calcutta presidency, where the salt tax was kept inhumanely high. This barrier -- a hedge -- was comparable in size to the Great Wall of China. Moxham's writing is brilliant, and his observations as he travels through central India in search of remnants of a hedge that no one seemed to know about are sharp. Moxham's combination of studiousness and sense of adventure brings out a historical fact that was, strangely, overlooked by historians from two countries. I will definitely be reading more of Roy Moxham's books.\nThe Great Hedge of India was a minor detour from what was my project for the year - finishing Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. I had read Eco's The Foucault's Pendulum in 2020, and was given\u0026nbsp;The Name of the Rose (along with Quichotte) as a gift by an unknown secret-santa I was matched with in a reddit book exchange. I expected this book to take immense effort, and it did. The Name of the Rose is, on the surface, a detective novel. But this is a pretense for Eco to portray his immense research of 14th century Italy, where Christianity is beset by turbulence. The pope is in a conflict with the Italian emperor and shifts the papal throne from Rome to Avignon, France. There are theological debates on whether Jesus Christ owned property, and the debates are significant because Benedictine monasteries are getting wealthier. There are sects that put their side of the theological debate to practice, burning rich bishops and destroying property. There are also philosophical disputes on whether God meant for Man to laugh -- for some see humor as more dangerous to authority than violence. Within this context is a series of murders and an immense library set in the form of a labyrinth, with William of Baskerville (a nod to Sherlock Holmes and William of Occam, of the Occam's razor) attempting to solve the puzzle using logic.\u0026nbsp; Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose is a postmodern literary achievement, and completing it is my humble personal achievement.\nI generally don't reread books, but after we read the Caste, I proposed something related to my diversity and inclusion book club. Ants Among Elephants by Sujatha Gidla\u0026nbsp;is a brutally raw read for Americans who do not have a lot of exposure to India, but I am glad I suggested it. I had reviewed it a couple of years earlier here. I liked the book the second time as well.\nI went back to my bookshelf to pick an unread book, and I selected a short one that I wanted to finish quickly. Yasunari Kawabata's The Dancing Girl of Izu and Other Stories is a short story collection by the Japanese Nobel Prize laureate. The first few stories, including the titular one, are excellent. I lost the plot with the so-called \"palm-stories\" that are very short, allegorical in nature and need some context on Japanese mythologies and folklore. Yasunari Kawabata is from the school of modernism and his writing is poetic; and it has always been a struggle for me to understand both.\nI went completely out of my TBR list with Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby, a horror thriller set in the 1960s U.S.A. I enjoyed learning about the pop cultural references from half-century ago. Rosemary's Baby had a weirdly fascinating climax that worked for me. I followed Rosemary's Baby with one another book that has been on my TBR for many years now - Aldous Huxley's\u0026nbsp;The Brave New World. The book edition I read comes with a foreword by Cristopher Hitchens, and the long essay called the\u0026nbsp;Brave New World Revisited written by the author himself more than 30 years since the publication of his dystopian novel. Reading all three together, I was not able to separate Huxley's problematic views on race and eugenics from his book of ideas. Despite Huxley's astute observations on how distraction and happiness are potent weapons for a fascist dictator, The Brave New World did not work for me.\u0026nbsp;\nI ended the year with another book picked by the diversity and inclusion group at my organization. The group was reeling from the impact of Caste and Ants Among Elephants, and decided to go with fiction.\u0026nbsp;Bring Me the Head of Quentin Tarantino stories\u0026nbsp;by Julian Herbert is a collection of short stories, with the titular story being more of a novella. The stories are set in Mexico or deal with Mexican characters, and like the list of books I read this year, it is hard to categorize the stories. They are postmodern, and extremely well-written. The titular story is narrated by a film reviewer who is kidnapped by a dangerous cartel boss desiring to assassinate Quentin Tarantino. We get a summary of the narrator's masters thesis on the subjects of literary review, with a focus on Shakespeare and Tarantino, intercut with violence and intrigue. The other stories are equally fascinating, with unreliable narrators, elements of magical realism, a lot of absurdity, and humor. I especially loved a story about a half-eaten croissant left on a German train seat. I do not think I completely understood a few stories from this collection, but Julian Herbert is a fascinating author I would explore more.\nAnd that's about it. Goodreads tells me that I read about 4200 pages this year. That is nothing to be proud of, but I will take it. I am happy to be reading at all.\u0026nbsp;Here\u0026nbsp;is a Goodreads summary of the books I read this year, with the original picture used above.\nWish you all a great new year and happy reading.\n","date":"30 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-2021-in-books/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My 2021 in books","type":"posts"},{"content":"\nHe said he was trying to write about impossible, obsessional love, father-son relationship, sibling quarrels, and yes, unforgivable things; about Indian immigrants, racism towards them, crooks among them; about cyber spies, science fictional and \"real\" realities, the death of the author, the end of the world.. incorporate elements of the periodic, and of satire and pastiche...

Ever since I learnt about his latest novel, Quichotte, set in present day U.S.A, I was waiting with anticipation. Having spent my last 4 years in the U.S.A, I can completely relate to his categorization of the current times, here and elsewhere, as the \"Age of Anything-Can-Happen\", where \"a whole nation can jump off a cliff like swarming lemmings\". In his Postscript to The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco writes that the \"postmodern reply to the modern consists of recognizing that the past, since it cannot really be destroyed, because its destruction leads to silence, must be revisited; but with irony, not innocently\", adding that postmodern texts are categorized by \"Irony, metalinguistic play, enunciation squared\". As far as I understand, meta-modernism is postmodernism infused with hope and sincerity, and if this understanding is correct, Quichotte is a meta-modern novel. It is loosely based on Don Quixote by Cervantes, a so-called picaresque novel consisting of various episodic narratives on a quest.\nIt is not easy to summarize Quichotte. It primarily seems to be about a \"traveling man of Indian origins, advancing years, and retreating mental powers.. Incipiently unstable, unpredictably capricious, increasingly erratic, and mulishly obsessional cast of mind\". However, it is also about a mildly successful author trying to write a career-defining novel, about a greedy pharmaceutical company owner who profits of the use of an injectable opioid substance. There are his victims, who have their own complexities in life, who feel that \"(t)hese days the only way to experience joy was through chemistry. \", and hence play a willing role in their own destruction (\"It's lithium and Haldol and Haldol and lithium. Can't do without it pals, doll, and so I just live withium\"). There is a former Bollywood actress who has established herself in Hollywood as some sort of a mixture of Priyanka Chopra, Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. There is an imagined character, and a character imagined by this imagined character, and a talking cricket imagined by the latter. There is a former immigration lawyer who is on the verge of being \"cancelled\" despite having led a life dedicated to rights of the unrepresented (\"To be a lawyer in a lawless time was like being a clown among the humorless: which was to say, either completely redundant or absolutely essential.\"). And there is a not-so-subtle parody of Elon Musk, in name and in persona : “Evel Cent, a bad stink. To some people that was what he was, an unpleasant self-promoting capitalist fart, but to others, mostly young others, he seemed like a kind of prophet, and here he was on television, doing a prophet’s work while also justifying the opinions of those who thought him a phony egotist skunk.”\nIf that is not rich enough, there are pop culture and literary references galore. The narrative structure is borrowed from Don Quixote, and there are repeated references to Pinocchio as well. There are references to Tennyson, Hans Christian Anderson, Moby Dick, The Death of a Salesman, Arthur C. Clarke, and more. Salman Rushdie's primary window into the American mindset seems to be through T.V. shows and movies, so there is a humungous list of pop culture references about every kind of show that's on American cable T.V., most of which I am not familiar with. This is another sense in which Quichotte is postmodern.\nBut Quichotte is not just an encyclopedia of books and stories to read, myths to know and T.V. Shows to watch (or skip). There are some very well developed characters spanning mid-20th century Bombay, the U.S. and the U.K. Rushdie seems to have made a conscious decision to portray every major character as an Indian immigrant. The core of the story consists of genuine issues such as child abuse, sibling rivalry, familial dynamics, and grievances that fester and manifest in complex ways and resonate across continents and time. There is also a New Jersey town whose people turn into mastodons, in a glaring metaphor for neighbors who turn unrecognizable thanks to conspiracy theories. Of course, the title itself demands a mention of Q-Anon, and we get it, almost as an afterthought. On the flipside, Quichotte needs some patience to get through. The references and sometimes unnecessary\u0026nbsp;facts that pepper the narrative hinder it. It is hard to keep track of what is imaginary and what is real in the frame of frame of frame narrative, but if you take a mental step back, you realize that it is the imagination of Rushdie that we glimpse into. Quichotte begins with a road trip across the U.S.A which sounds extremely exciting in theory. But the journey is largely flat, except for a couple of incidences of racism\u0026nbsp;in mid-western U.S.A. Finally, this is a book about the literate, for the literate.\u0026nbsp;\"A good knowledge is the classics is the sign of an educated man\" says one of the characters. But it seems off-putting at times to read a book where every character is well versed in literature, especially when the primary setting is a country and time where derision of literature and arts is on the rise.\nI read Quichotte a few months ago and it was not a breezy read. Looking back now for writing this review, I have fonder memories of the book. Rushdie's observation on the present day U.S.A. is on the dot : \"this is the way things are these days in America: that for some of us, the world stopped making sense. Anything can happen. Here can be there, then can be now, up can be down, truth can be lies. Everything is slip-sliding around and there's nothing to hold on to. The whole thing has come apart in seams. For some of us, who have started seeing the stuff the rest of us are too blind to see. Or too determined not to see.\" His solution to this is story tellers, and immigrants. And in making a case for immigrants, he also defends his complex and sprawling narrative. An interjection, kind reader, if you'll allow one: it may be argued that stories should not sprawl in this way, that they should be grounded in one place or the other, put down roots in the other or the one and flower in that singular soil; yet so many of today's stories are and must be of this plural, sprawling kind, because a kind of nuclear fission has taken place in human lives and relations, families have been divided, millions upon millions of us have traveled to the four corners of the (admittedly spherical, and therefore cornerless) globe, whether by necessity or choice. Such broken families may be our best available lenses through which to view this broken world. And inside the broken families are broken people, broken by loss, poverty, maltreatment, failure, age, sickness, pain, and hatred, yet trying in spite of all to cling to hope and love, and these broken people--we, the broken people!--may be the best mirrors of our times, shining shards that reflect the truth, wherever we travel, wherever we land, whatever we remain. For we migrants have become like seed-spores, carried through the air, and lo, the breeze blows is where it will, until we lodge in an alien soil, where very often, we are made to feel unwelcome, no matter how beautiful the fruit hanging from the branches of the orchards of fruit trees that we grow into and become.You will enjoy this book if his argument convinces you. I did.\u0026nbsp;\n","date":"9 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-salman-rushdies-quichotte/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Salman Rushdie's Quichotte","type":"posts"},{"content":"It is hard to classify Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis. The medium is Bande_dessinée – a French precursor of what English readers would come to term as the graphic novel. But this is not a novel, it is a memoir of a teenager growing up in tumultuous times in Iran. Marjane Satrapi’s narration starts during the Iranian revolution which ultimately led to the overthrow of Iran’s last Shah belonging to the house of Pahlavi. We then go into a brief flashback to get introduced to Satrapi as a kid, her parents, and her grandmother. Marjane Satrapi grows up in an upper middle class household which is not particularly religious, and her writing has a sparkling sense of humor, conveyed both through her words and illustration. There is profundity, but Satrapi does not dwell on it.\nSatrapi, as many great writers, grows up with books. And she soon discovers communism, thanks to a leaning towards Marx\u0026rsquo;s ideas that already exists in her family. However, her family, like many others, are communists only in the abstract.\nAs we get back to the present, we learn that Satrapi has a royal lineage on her maternal side, with her grandfather being one the many last princes of the Qajar family. The Pahlavi dynasty is installed by means of a coup d\u0026rsquo;tat supported by the U.S.A. and the British government against a democratically elected leader. Why? Well, oil. As the revolution heats up and Satrapi\u0026rsquo;s parents take an active role in the anti-regime protests, we see violence in the streets, and we witness incidents such as the Cinema Rex fire, which killed more than 400 people. Though the Satrapi family believe firmly that the Shah was responsible for this incident, there is no historical agreement on this fact. Ultimately, the Shah is exiled, and takes refuge in Egypt as the Western powers \u0026ndash; Jimmy Carter being at the stewardship of the U.S.A. \u0026ndash; lose interest in him.\nHowever, the joy is short lived as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini takes over the reins, and Islamic conservatism becomes mainstream. We also learn about a revolutionary streak on Satrapi\u0026rsquo;s paternal side, as the new regime starts persecuting people, closing down universities, and implementing an Islamic constitution.\nBut that is not all. Iran soon get into a war with Saddam Hussein\u0026rsquo;s Iraq, and we witness the impact of this war first hand, until Satrapi is sent to Austria for continuing her studies. This is an eventful book, and Satrapi is forced to pack a bunch of information in an unusual format. Despite this, she keeps the tone light and does not lose focus on the wishes and desires of an adolescent girl. It is worth re-emphasizing that Marjane Satrapi has a terrific sense of humor, sometimes of the gallows kind. She attributes this to the Persian outlook of life shaped by generations living in a historically turbulent region.\nHowever, this lightness of tone was the first problem with Persepolis for me. This book is targeted primarily at adolescent readers as an introduction to the complexity, and also relatability (for people are the same everywhere), of life in Iran. Reading this as an adult, I feel a desire to know more about the events and incidents hinted by her. The second problem, if I may call it that, is the background of the Satrapi family, which admittedly only in some small ways, protects them from the most tragic aspects of war and revolution. This is not something that the author could control, and certainly not something that invalidates her experience of living in Iran. The solution to both these problems lie simply in me exploring more about Iran and the history of the middle east, and reading first hand accounts from many different perspectives.\nPersepolis does not lack profundity, and my favorite fragment is this line uttered against nationalist fervor :\n","date":"7 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-marjane-satrapis-persepolis/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis","type":"posts"},{"content":"\n\u0026nbsp;\"It\u0026nbsp; takes a certain kind of person to live in China now,\" Chen mused.\n\"What kind of person?\", Mary asked.\n“Someone who can see true meanings, someone who does not only want the world better but believes it can be made better, and gets angry because it's not done, someone who is not willing to hide himself in one of the few good places left in the world-someone who is tough!”\nPearl S.Buck was an American born and brought up in China. This gave her a window into two vastly different cultures. Though her credibility as a representative of Chinese culture to the English speaking world has been questioned, I believe her mixed background is perfect for a novel like Kinfolk, which begins in Manhattan and moves into hinterland China. Kinfolk follows the Liang family as they grapple with the problem of being immigrants in America and of being outsiders in China.\nThe novel is set in the middle to late 1940s with a tumultuous background (“we have finished with one age to begin another”). Post the Japanese invasion, China was in the final stages of Chiang Kai-Shek’s nationalist government before Mao’s declaration of the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Dr. Liang is a Chinese intellectual settled in the U.S.A, writing for western readers. He has a firm belief in Confucian values and a stubborn moral center. But the China in his mind is the China of the past, and though he paints a rosy picture of his homeland, he realizes that he does not belong to the China of the present. “Surely men like myself represent more perfectly than peasants can the spirit of Chinese civilization. Our nation has always been ruled by our intellectuals”, he says at one point. Surely, not a view that would be appreciated by peasants in the midst of a revolution against their landowning feudal lords.\nBut Kinfolk’s primary focus is on Dr.Liang’s children - James, Mary, Peter and Lili. James and Mary feel a great desire to contribute to their home country. Peter and Lily, born in the U.S.A., are more Americanized. James, a skilled surgeon, takes up a job in his home land and, due to circumstances, is joined by his siblings. Kinfolk deals with their journey in trying to adapt to their home country, and getting accepted by their extended family. At the heart of the novel is a conflict between modernism and tradition, with Pearl S.Buck trying not to take a stand either way.\nPersonally, Kinfolk started off on a relatable note, thanks to the setting in Manhattan, especially the localities around Riverside Drive. Dr. Liang’s attempt to balance pride in his ancestry and shame on aspects that the Western World would consider despicable is also well portrayed : “Americans tend to think too little of us, and we should not therefore lend ourselves to their low opinion“, he says.\u0026nbsp;\nKinfolk is structured in the mold of a classic, with well defined characters and fairly predictable character arcs. James is the character around whom the plot revolves, and he grapples to resolve the conflict between his scientific training as a surgeon and the traditional values of his ancestral relatives. Mary is his closest confidante, with a “honesty that will not be corrupted”. Her headstrongness clashes with the traditional patriarchy of her hometown. Peter is in an impressionable age, and has strong opinions. His initial reaction in China is “I don't like living in a country where everything is falling to pieces and all that is worth talking about is the past”. Lili is fully Americanized, and has the entitlement of an American. “Lili was so soft, she yielded everywhere -- until one knew she had really yielded nowhere.”\nThere are other interesting characters in the fray as well. Liu Chen is the most admirable among these. He gets to mouth lines such as “scholar, landlord, magistrate, warlord - there you have the tyrants of the people”, and probably reflects the views of the author the most. I couldn’t help but love Young Wong, whose outlook of life is simply surmised by “with my belly certain of fullness three times a day, I fear no god or man”. However, the best character in Kinfolk is undoubtedly Mrs. Liang. Her defining characterestic is, at least initially, just that “she never thought of herself”. But as Mary comes to realize, “her mother was not at all a stupid woman. It was true that hers was a brain which could neither receive nor retain an abstract idea, that is, an idea that has nothing to do with the simple welfare of those she loved. Heaven, God, Government, Communism, War, Human Rights, Religion, all the large words which provided modern arguement she tolerated as amusement only for men”.\u0026nbsp;\nBut Kinfolk is not a perfect novel. It’s classical style makes the actions of some of the characters predictable. The 1940s is a tumultuous period in Chinese history, but the backdrop does not convincingly weave into the story. I expected to learn more about the upheavals in society, but Kinfolk’s focus is narrower. It seems as if the author does not want to take a political stance, and wants to take a centrist attitude in the tradition versus modernism debate. The conclusion is abrupt as well. Pearl S. Buck does attempt to anticipate this criticism with the concluding lines “what is the end of the story? There is no end. Life folds into life, and the river flows on”. It did not work for me. What worked for me however is the portrayal of Mrs. Liang. She is portrayed as a “bridge between these centuries” (the 18th century of pastoral China and the 20th century of modern China). In fact her transition into one of the central characters in the eyes of Mary is what made this book work for me.\n","date":"5 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-pearl-s.bucks-kinfolk/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Pearl S.Buck's Kinfolk","type":"posts"},{"content":"\n\u0026nbsp;A house gun. If it hadn't been there how could you defend yourself, in this city, against losing your hi-fi equipment, your television set and computer, your watch and rings, against being gagged, raped, knifed. If it hadn't been there the man on the sofa would not be under the ground of the city.\nNadine Gordimer’s The House Gun begins with Harold and Claudia, an upper-middle class white couple in post-apartheid South Africa, getting an urgent message from their son’s friend. As is natural, they fear bad news, and the news is bad, but not in the way they expected. They discover that their son has been arrested and held responsible for a murder. The House Gun explores their state of mind as they process this information and go through their son's trial, in the process exploring the psychology of their son, each other, and themselves.\nThe House Gun is unlike any other novel I have read, in terms of the aloofness it maintains from its central characters. This would put off a lot of readers. But despite this being my first encounter with Nadine Gordimer’s writings, I suspect that this detachment from her characters is deliberate. After all, Harold and Claudia themselves lead a life detached from any outsiders -- including each other -- living by the unsaid motto that that they “never belonged in the public expression of private opinions”. Claudia is an atheist and a doctor, someone who attaches significance to the close physical contact she has with her patients on a day to day basis. Harold is a catholic, and a corporate executive. He is also “what is known as a great reader, which means a searcher after something that is ambitiously called the truth; both conditional concepts he would be the first, amusedly, to concede”.\u0026nbsp;\nHarold and Claudia are liberal from afar. Which means that in theory, they support equality, are open to people making their own choices, and try not to be racist. But they are prey to their conditioned instincts. Hence they take a skeptical view when their son hires a black lawyer. This is not racist, they say - or rather, they think, for this is a novel that operates purely on a psychological level. They justify this, as one would : “We don't have to attribute that doubt to racist prejudice, because it is a fact, incontrovertible fact, that due to refusal prejudices in the old regimes, black lawyers have had far less expertise than white lawyers, and experience is what counts. They've had fewer chances to prove themselves; it's their disadvantage, and you would not be showing racial prejudice in seeing that disadvantage as yours, if entrusting defense to most of them.” As they discover more about their son, we learn more about the prejudices they still hold. Liberalism from afar is great, but how hard is it to be progressive when it involves your own children?\u0026nbsp;\nNadine Gordimer’s writing is as precise as a swiss watch. Even the professions of the characters are meant to convey their characteristics. But the same precision contributes to the book’s aloofness, making it difficult to relate to any of the characters. This is a shame, since some of these characters exhibit a great potential to be explored in much more depth. Personally, this book made, and continues to make, me ruminate on a lot of themes - what it means to be truly liberal, remnants of racial tensions in post-apartheid South Africa, gun violence, parenting, capital punishment, possessiveness in a romantic relationship (“He closes his hands on what he wants so tightly that he kills it”), and marriage. I enjoyed the book, but I would be cautious in recommending it to everyone.\n","date":"4 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-nadine-gordimers-the-house-gun/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Nadine Gordimer's The House Gun","type":"posts"},{"content":"I have a link to my blog in my resume, which also smugly mentions \"writing\" as one of my hobbies.

I was recommended the book many years back by a friend and never got to it. I finally managed to read it this year after wrestling through Umberto Eco's terrific\u0026nbsp;Focault's Pendulum last year. Unfortunately, the graphic novel did not make as much an of impression on me as the movie did a few years back, primarily because the movie had been a mostly faithful adaptation. Also, Alan Moore's focus is more on the plot than the characters. Regardless, Alan Moore's seminal work is definitely recommended for its originality and vision.\nThe classic A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens had always been on my wish-list. I had read the famous opening lines (\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\") and the first few pages a couple of times as a kid, but I finally managed to plough through them shamefully late in my life. Reading it now, the characters and their dialogue seem overly dramatic. However, Charles Dickens' mastery over plot construction and tying up loose ends is evident throughout. Dickens does a wonderful job of capturing the apathy of French aristocracy that leads to the violence, ugly in his eyes, of the French Revolution. Even though the twists and turns were predictable, this was still a fun read.\nI then took a slight diversion into popular novels with John Grisham's The Appeal. When a Mississippi court rules against a chemical company for polluting a town's water supply with toxic waste, the company's shares take a dive. The company's owner appeals, and aims to install a Supreme Court judge who would rule in favor of corporations. The Appeal was written in 2008, but the politics of America is largely similar. John Grisham highlights the conservative machinery with churches, corporations, and multi-million dollar donors working in tandem to try and uproot a perceived (a perception they create) liberal female judge. There is even a Trump like wildcard character thrown in the mix. The only dated factor in Grisham's page turner is the fact that in today's world, the wildcard would be the protagonist.\nMy surprise pick and probably my best read this year was Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer. I take pride in accidentally discovering books that make a significant impact on me. I have been living in the suburbs of Boston for a year and a half without realizing that I did not have to reside in Boston city to be a member of the Boston Public Library. As a quick side note, one thing people did not tell me about life in the US is that the libraries here are amazing. They are extremely welcoming places with a ton of resources, most of them free. Anyway, the Boston Public Library had a curated list of Pulitzer Prize winners which introduced me to Viet Than Nguyen, apart from making me aware of the fact that there is a Pulitzer Price category for fiction. His The Sympathizer cannot be fit into a single genre. It is part historical fiction, part Conrad-ish spy novel, and mostly a study of culture of three people - Vietnamese, American, and Vietnamese-American. Amazingly, the author's wit allows him to fit all these into 300 odd pages. The one downside is, again, the characterization, or the lack thereof, of women. If I, this blog, and the world survive 2021, I expect that my next edition of this post will contain Viet Thanh Nguyen's sequel to The Sympathizer -\u0026nbsp;The Committed.\nI love Bill Bryson, and his ability to explore a subject deeply and convey it to readers with wit and humor.\u0026nbsp; Having read a few of his travelogues before, I picked up his\u0026nbsp;A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail this year. This time, Bill Bryson attempts, unsuccessfully, to hike the complete Appalachian Train, spanning more than 2000 miles from Georgia to Maine. His adventures simultaneously encourage and dissuade us from attempting a similar exercise. But I do wish to visit parts of the trail in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine one of these days. Bill Bryson does seem a bit uncharacteristically mean and cruel in this work while describing the people he encounters in this hike. From my own experience, I am guessing it is age. For some reason, as I get older, other people are turning into senseless morons.\nAnother accidental discovery through a recommendation from Boston Public Library was China Meivelle's The City and the City, winner of the Hugo Awards for 2010. Belonging to a genre called Weird Fiction, Meivelle's work imagines two cities that are located in the same geographical place, but which are separated by culture, and strictly imposed ability of people to \"unsee\" the other city if they lay eyes on \"foreign\" people, buildings and streets. Conceptually this was difficult to wrap my head around. But so would borders be to a tribal people. Once you accept Meivelle's strange setting, the plot is a reasonably regular investigative thriller. I wouldn't call The City and the City an extraordinarily good novel. But it makes you think, introduces you to a world of possibilities, and allows you to reflect on your own world. That's good enough for me. I would definitely explore more of China Meivelle's works.\nI grabbed another classic, The Old Man and The Sea by Ernest Hemingway next\u0026nbsp;primarily because of how short the book his (a little more than 100 pages). This is a simple, but gripping tale of grit and determination. I couldn't relate to the setting and milieu surrounding a fisherman in a Cuban coast. But that didn't stop me from enjoying this quick read.\nI then tried my hand with\u0026nbsp;Fyodor\u0026nbsp;Dostoyevsky's's The Gambler. I had loved Crime and Punishment when I had read it ages back. The Gambler is primarily focused on addiction, something I can relate to thanks to my own addiction to consuming content. This is a fairly short work written when the author himself was recovering from a bout of addiction, and the characterization is not as sharp as in Crime and Punishment. However, there are still moments I loved. There is always something to learn from the work of a master.\nI ended this year with Nadine Gordimer The House Gun. There was a book sale at my local public library where I was allowed to grab a huge bagful of books for a measly $5. I picked a few books solely because the covers indicated that the authors were Nobel Prize winners. In this work, Nadine Gordimer introduces us to post-apartheid South Africa, where violence is widespread and guns are commonplace. An upper middle class couple's lives are upturned when their son confesses to a crime of passion. Nadine Gordimer takes us through their personal struggle, while setting up a macro view of political, social, and legal changes in the country. While I enjoyed the macro view, I couldn't sympathize completely with the lead characters. Gordimer conveniently uses their professions as a stand-in for their personality. As a software engineer who rarely makes logical decisions, I found myself personally attacked. This was still an eye-opening read that gave me a lot to think about.\u0026nbsp;\nI have mentioned earlier in this blog that I strongly feel there is a right time to read certain books. Here is something that reinforced that belief in me. The House Gun was published in 1999. The novel depicts a South African court that is built replacing a former quarantine center, leading to to this exchange between a couple of characters.\nWhere do people with infectious disease go now?\u0026nbsp;\nVery slowly, she smiled, for him. Most of those epidemics don't exist any more. So no more Fever Hospital. People are inoculated as children. What we have to worry about medically is only communicated intimately, as you know; so it wouldn't be right to isolate the carriers from ordinary contacts, moving about among us.\nReading this in 2020, I couldn't suppress the thought that Nadine Gordimer might have won a Nobel Prize in Literature. But she is not winning one for clairvoyance.\nPS : I promised myself that if I finish this post, I will include the image referred to earlier from \"My 2019 in books\". So, here we go.\nImage source : https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4391307-adarsh\n","date":"1 January 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-2020-in-books/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My 2020 in books","type":"posts"},{"content":" Hi there! Long time. How’ you been? I have been fine, thanks for asking. Well, wait! Actually, not so much. I have been avoiding\u0026nbsp;people like plague. I have been frustrated about how things are turning out to be. To the collective us. I have been fighting an\u0026nbsp;early onset of a midlife crisis. Mostly, I have been irritated by things I should ignore.\u0026nbsp; I learnt today that there is a start-up that’s like Airbnb for Indian weddings.\u0026nbsp; For a small commission, this start-up acts as a platform connecting people who want to experience weddings from a different culture (limited to India at the moment) with couples looking to host such people. You pay, meet your hosts virtually,\u0026nbsp; probably meet them physically, and you can partake in a desi wedding.\u0026nbsp; I can't help but wonder, who pays to attend a wedding?\u0026nbsp; Even in my prime days of gregariousness (let me think.. that one Saturday 4 years back, and one other time),\u0026nbsp; I would rather not attend a wedding. I mean, weddings are nice and all, but the representative Indian wedding is made up of more than dancing, flavourful food, fashionable gaudy clothes, and fancy celebrations. Most Indian weddings are made up of crippling debts,\u0026nbsp;unwilling protagonists,\u0026nbsp;simmering family feuds,\u0026nbsp;the bawling child who slipped from a chair and hurt her nose,\u0026nbsp; unsatisfied guests and the mysterious thief who steals half a pair of footwear. Also,\u0026nbsp;who hosts strangers at their wedding for money? Definitely not people who struggle for money. The hosts are likely to be the sort of people who can afford to put up a grand show for white people seeking \"genuine cultural celebration\" and \"immersive experiences\". These are\u0026nbsp;also the sort of people who put up wishlists for wedding gifts.\u0026nbsp; Wealth begets wealth. It shouldn’t, and that’s what irritates me the most about the direction the World is heading in.\nSource :\u0026nbsp;Some couples in India are selling tourist admissions to their weddings\u0026nbsp;(CNBC)\nImage Source :\u0026nbsp;http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/allwoman/I-am-getting-married-for-money--not-love_15699014\n* Taxes may apply ","date":"16 October 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/join-my-wedding/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Join my wedding*","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 October 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mini-rants/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mini-Rants","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 October 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/opinion/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Opinion","type":"tags"},{"content":" Snippets: Short Stories by Roshani Gash Sinha\nMy rating: 4 of 5 stars\nNote:\u0026nbsp;The author\u0026nbsp;of this book, Roshani Sinha, is a friend, and I had read a few of the stories from Snippets prior to its publication. Snippets is an apt title for this wonderful collection of ten short stories, for they are just that - snippets from various lives at different stages of relationships. These are not stories with a conventional plot and a three-act structure. Snippets is more an exploration of emotions of\u0026nbsp;the characters.\u0026nbsp; Creativity and relationships seem to be the common\u0026nbsp;motifs among most of the stories. Ten Puffs portrays a man reminiscing his past, his present and his future. Free Falling delves into the mind of a psychologist who is attracted to broken men. This is one of the best-written stories of the collection. Grains of Sand is about the cathartic experience of being involved in a creative pursuit and portrays a snapshot of an artist's life. The Metier is again set in the art scene. It is a sort of a coming-of-age story where a young girl (a student of psychology, once again) finds her calling. Test of Time portrays a long-lasting relationship and explores why such relationships work.\u0026nbsp;Reminders and Suitcase deal with coming to terms with loss in different settings. My favorite story out of the series is probably Modus Vivendi, which explores, among other things, jealousy. Modus Vivendi is about the compromises one is ready to make to be viewed as a success\u0026nbsp;by the society. The protagonist’s remark “my self-righteousness principles and ideas seemed laughable to the world I lived in today, but it felt right to me” resonates with me deeply. Foreclosure and Dreamcatchers both add some variety to the collection. The former is rendered from the point of view of a child (“I am eight years old, but I know and understand more than they think I do”). Dreamcatchers, on the other hand, leaps into the realm of fantasy on the lines of a Haruki Murakami plot. Many of the protagonists of the Snippets are writers and artists. Roshani uses her great vocabulary to describe the physicality of her settings. The geographies and the timeframe are not specifically mentioned in any of the stories. While this makes them seem not rooted in a specific place or time, it also frees the narratives from temporal and geographical constraints. There were a couple of typos in the publication, but for a self-published work, the book looks professional by large and has some great artwork. The characters in Roshani's Snippets are all very decent people, with flaws but without evil intentions. Their concerns are not struggles of life and death. This may seem monotonous at times, but we could all do with the occasional positivity. For a first-time writer’s work, Snippets has a lot of great things. I look forward to reading more of Roshani’s works.

She had to move to a different country, the USA, to realize the unfairness of her life in India. Her opening lines in Ants Among Elephants are \"My stories, my family's stories, were not stories in India. They were just life\". I can relate to this; moving to Qatar taught me that I had been on the nicer side of the unfairness. This acceptance does not come easily though, and -- to use a phrase favoured by Sujatha Gidla -- \"even to this day\", I have the tendency to get riled up or turn defensive on this topic. There is no surprise in the fact then that when Sujatha Gidla remarks \"all Christians in India were untouchables, as far as I knew\" \u0026nbsp;and adds that \"I knew no Christian who did not turn servile in the presence of a Hindu\", my immediate reaction was to deny the exaggeration.\u0026nbsp;But then, my unawareness of the caste system is by itself a manifestation of my privilege, and it is time that people like me listen to voices like Sujatha Gidla's. After all, \"even to this day\", caste plays a significant, life-changing role in large parts of India. The two principal characters of Ants Among Elephants are Satyam and Manjula; the writer's maternal-uncle and mother respectively. Satyam is K.G. Satyamurthy, a revolutionary, an intellectual, an acclaimed poet (going by the pen name Sivasagar), \u0026nbsp;and a founding member of the left-extremist People's War Group (\"the most notorious, famous and successful Naxalite party, a thorn in the side of Indian rulers\"). Manjula is a woman growing up in India as an untouchable. Their struggles are equally dramatic and arresting. Ants Among Elephants begins before the independence of India. While Sujatha Gidla promises us a tale of the cruelty of caste system, Ants Among Elephants is much more. The tales of Gidla's maternal family is actually a testament to the complexity of India as a country, where people are so abundant and lives so cheap that inhumanity does not take a single form. Lives are drastically affected by myriad macro-events - a flooding of the\u0026nbsp;Godavari river; the Japansese bombing of Vizag; the presence of Razakars, a brutal army of Islamic militants serving the Nizam of Hyderabad; the suppression of this brutality by and the subsequent cruelty of the equally ruthless Indian Army; the Chattel system, which the Gidla refers to as \"a modern product of the capitalist world market\"; the vetti (forced labour)\u0026nbsp;system; the struggle for the separate state of Telangana and much more. We see that casteism was omnipotent, with members of every caste (including the Untouchables) mistreating what they considered as the lower castes. The historical context is also educational in many ways. For instance, one of the many things I learnt was how the country began to get divided by linguistic barriers thanks to relentless protests in Andhra. I felt that in her introduction to the book Sujatha Gidla came across as unemotional to the point of seeming cold. At one point, she remarks that \"as of this writing, I do not know if this book's principal subject is alive or dead\" (Satyamurthy died in 2012). But this detachment becomes an advantage, as she does not balk from the flaws of her subjects. So much so that the subjects become characters and we forget that these were actual people doing their best in troubled circumstances. All of us commit mistakes, but when you are at the bottom of the social ladder, your mistakes become irreversible. Sujatha Gidla is so impersonal that she even refers to her own birth in third person. This quality gives Ants Among Elephants an objectivity, allowing her to unflinchingly examine moments like her father's domestic abuse of her mother. On the flip-side, the fact that there are so many threads within the tapestry of Sujatha Gidla's work cause it to seem rushed at times. I wonder if the relatively shortness book (a little more than 300 pages) contributes to this feeling. One of the many caste names Sujatha Gidla keeps referring to is \"paki\", which sounds very similar to a derogatory word in Tamil. I have a strong suspicion that the origin of the word is caste-based. The effects of caste system is not always explicit. Casteism has seeped into us in ways we can not even imagine. \u0026nbsp;Like Arundathi Roy's The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, Ants Among Elephants is a significant work that forces us to take an unflinching look at the past and present of India.\u0026nbsp;After a low profile release in the USA, the book still managed to gather rave reviews and is being released in India now. I highly recommend this book, especially to the Indians who feel that historical injustice does not affect the present.

He allowed a couple of minutes silence and said,\n\"Darling, I asked you to use the complete stage!\"\nThey were in classroom 28 of Rajaji Girls Primary school, whose principal had generously offered to host their practice sessions after school hours, provided that they would not litter the campus. The room was packed with eager students and teachers who had stayed late to watch the practice, but it was clearly not dense enough to contain TVR sir's loud and angry baritone -- a voice which had permanently frightened away many of his erstwhile disciples.\u0026nbsp; \"And there are going to be more than 500 heads watching you on your big day. With your Pralokita, make eye contact with each and every person in the audience.\"\nTVR sir was the most sought after Bharatanatyam teacher in Thenkudi. A proud winner of the Natiya Arthakovida award presented by his state, he had a famous temper. Students feared him, but their parents would do anything to get him teach their daughters and sons. His attention today was solely on 13-year-old Radha.\u0026nbsp; Start again!\", he continued as his voice pierced a silence no one else had seen fit to break, \"and this will be the last time.\" His tone turned to a warning as he completed, \"No more mistakes.\"\n\"Thalangu thakathimi..\" he sang abruptly, and Haravahanan -- who had lifted a water bottle to quench his thirst during -- hurriedly placed it down and attempted to catch-up with the booming voice. No one would have noticed if he had missed a beat or two though, for every pair of eyes in the room was focussed on Radha's Shabda. Radha quickly adopted a hourglass-like stance, and started moving to her master's chants. Gradually, as the pace quickened, she began to crouch, leap, swirl, skip, spring, dart, and zip around the stage. Miming the story of Lord Krishna, she deftly transformed herself from the mischievous child God to the village maidens charmed by his pranks. For the next four minutes, the audience was transfixed by the grace and ease with which she performed the complicated movements, and they felt transported to Vrindavanam - the birth place of Krishna. They started applauding spontaneously towards the end of her performance when Krishna had killed the demon-king Kamsa. Radha completed her final motions and stood looking expectantly at her teacher, waiting for his verdict. One of the spectators shushed as TVR sir cleared his throat to speak and waited for absolute silence.\u0026nbsp; \"You need to concentrate on your Lasya\", he said when his silence was granted. \"You have a little more than a month. Practice hard, and get it perfected before I come back\".\nHaving said so, he strode out hastily without waiting for an acknowledgement. With a collective sigh of relief, the audience continued their applause. Radha thanked the crowd perfunctorily, but her eyes were fixed on a lady rushing out of the class. The lady stopped near the classroom door, acknowledged Radha with a quick smile and ran behind TVR sir. \u0026ldquo;Sir, how did she..\u0026quot;, she began before being interrupted. \u0026quot;\nMadam, I have been teaching students for 27 years now, and I have never seen anyone like your daughter. She is a natural. She is a prodigy. Do not worry, but do not let her get complacent.\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you very much sir. Her talent is a divine blessing. But we would feel less anxious if you were here to oversee her training before the event.\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I would very much like to, but my mother is not well. I need to visit her.\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course sir, I am sorry. We understand.\u0026quot;\nShe will be fine.\u0026quot; Saying so, he opened the door of his sedan, hesitated a little, and spoke again \u0026ndash; this time in an uncharacteristically soft and faraway voice \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;I will retire from teaching dance once her Arengetram is over. She will be my last student. She will be the best.\u0026quot;\nRadha stood with Meera and Jennifer on the veranda of her school building taking shelter from the unexpected February rains. A few other children waiting to be picked up by their parents stood around them in multiple pockets. Raja anna, the school watchman who sometimes doubled up as the back-up peon, stood with an umbrella on the now-sludgy mud that connected with the single lane tar road just outside the veranda. He was having a torrid time trying to direct the parents, with each of them wanting to park their cars as close as possible to the school building so as to not get their children’s shoes and their cars dirty. Rain is beautiful. Rain is irritating. Meera and Jennifer were discussing the school excursion to the town museum planned for next week. Jenny would be bringing some home baked cakes, while Meera had requested her mother to make bissibella bath. The children around them were chattering about the trip, and there was a cacophony of excited screechy voices. The most active of the lot had cast aside their bags at the veranda and were playing on the playgrounds across the road. Radha mentally replayed the conversation she had had with her parents last night during dinner, soon after her 3 hour dance practise.\u0026nbsp; \"Amma\", she had remarked hesitantly, and raised her voice a little more,\nAmma!\".\n\"Yes dear?\"\n\"They are taking us to an excursion at school..\"\n\"Really? Where to? And when?\"\n\"Next Tuesday. To the museum at Nallur.\" \"Oh, that's wonderful. You can have a whole day's practice.\" \"But amma, I want to go with them..\"\n\"Darling, what do you mean? You have only 3 weeks left. Be serious!\"\nHer father looked up at his wife's raised voice and joined in.\n\"Radha dear, you need to concentrate on what is important to you, and you should not exert yourself unnecessarily.\"\n\"But Meera and Jenny are going.\"\n\u0026ldquo;Let them. The museum is not worth a visit at all. If you want, I will take the three of you there after your Arengetram. For now, you should only be thinking of dance\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;MEERA! MEERA!\u0026quot; The girls looked around recognizing the voice of Kumar anna, the school peon. \u0026ldquo;Your father called. He said he is caught in traffic and that he will be here soon. He asked you three to wait near the veranda and..\u0026quot;\nHe was cut off midsentence by the shrill shriek. A girl with double-braided hair had fallen face down in the ground and she looked as if she was about to cry. As Kumar anna dashed into the rain to help her up, other girls around her laughed heartily at the awkwardness of the fall. The fallen girl hesitated, but quickly joined in the laughter as she helped herself up. Now that she was fine, Kumar anna rushed back to the shelter of the veranda cursing the little devils under his breath. But he was already drenched.\u0026nbsp; \"Shit! I forgot dad didn't go to office today!!\", said Meera excitedly.\nThe girls lived in the same locality, and their mothers took turns picking the three of them up in their cars. It was Meera's mother's turn today, and apparently her father was filling in. Rajendran was the coolest of all their parents, and the girls loved to be driven around by him. He even let them choose their favourite songs in his car's stereo.\u0026nbsp; \"Yay! Your dad wouldn't mind his car getting wet!\" remarked Jenny, as she rushed to the ground. Meera joined too. They both motioned at Radha to join them. Radha took a step forward, but then remembered the Arengetram. Mother would be mad if she got drenched in the rain and fell ill. She stood alone, looking at the playing children. Meera and Jenny had now broken into an impromptu jig, and a few other children joined them. Rain is beautiful. Rain is irritating. As if rain was not enough, the night was accompanied by strong winds too. And darkness. The only source of light was a distant island, illuminating a bunch of children running around happily. Closer examination showed that the light was atop a hill -- a dark brown hill completely made of chocolate. The kids stopped frequently to bite a slice off the hill, and amazingly, the hill seemed to replenish itself. Radha could spot a few more children lying around idly. This island did not have schools, or teachers, or parents; and she was wading through the waters towards it.\u0026nbsp; \"Come back, Radha!\" Her mother's voice.\nRadha turned around and in the darkness behind her, over an embankment, she identified her mother's silhouette. She could not make out her mother's face, but she could intuitively feel the anxiety in it. Mom’s hands were stretched out as if it could conquer the distance and hold Radha's. She hesitated, but continued walking towards the island. The winds were strong, the waves were pushing her backwards, and the rains blocked her vision. It was freezing too. She shivered.\u0026nbsp; \"She is boiling hot!\" her mother exclaimed.\n\"Sssh!! Do not wake her up. She needs rest. Does she need to go today?\", her father's voice shouted over the rain.\n\"Poor girl! She must be so tired. Let her take rest\"\n\"I will call Balki from the car and inform him\".\nShe looked behind her once more. Balki sir, her class-teacher, was standing on the embankment now. He too was frantically motioning at her to come back. She remembered that she had not completed her science assignment (\"collect ten varieties of leaves, stick them on a chart paper and label their parts\"). She glanced at her mother and still could not make out her face. But she sensed her mother crying. Tears that were being washed away by the rains, only to be replenished immediately; like the chocolaty hill. She hesitated once more, but turned around this time and started walking back slowly. She could instantly feel the smile in her mother's eyes. Something made her stop, and she stood undecided. As she stood there, she realized that she had been dreaming. She stirred a little and her mother who happened to be passing by her bedroom rushed in.\u0026nbsp; \"What's the time, mommy?\"\n\"Never mind that. It's late for school baby. You are staying home tonight.\"\n\"But..\"\n\"No buts! You have been working hard for the past few days. You need to get some rest. How does it feel now?\"\nWithout waiting for a response she pressed Radha's forehead, and let out a satisfied sigh of relief. \"Better. Get up and brush your teeth. Let me get something for you to eat. I will give you a Crocin after your breakfast, and you can sleep again\"\nThe sun shone brightly through the windows and there was silence all around; the silence of working day afternoons. Radha woke up tired having slept for the larger part of the morning. As she lay down for some more time, she could hear soft conversations from the TV in the living room. She stood up and lumbered towards it. Her mother was slumped on the floor, cutting vegetables for lunch.\u0026nbsp; \"Why are you up so soon? Go get some sleep\", she asked, turning around at the noise.\n\"I want to sit here\" \"Come here. Let's see if you still have a temperature.\"\nHaving convinced herself that Radha was fine, Radha's mother suggested a compromise.\n\"All right, bring your pillow and lie down on the sofa\".\nRadha huddled on the couch. Her mother reached for the remote control and increased the volume, which had apparently been kept low so as to not disturb her sleep. Radha tried watching the movie for a few minutes. A teenage daughter and her mother were having a conversation at the back seat of a car while on a journey down a picturesque hill. It was a Bengali movie. Radha's mother didn't know Bengali, but she liked to watch movies of all languages. Nothing seemed to happen in this movie, and people kept on talking. A little bored with it, Radha turned to watch her mother. She was briskly cutting carrots. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. The sharp knife was brought down at a steady pace, and the cut pieces were so uniform that they could have been made by a machine. Radha's mother had once confessed that she didn't exactly love cooking. Having to decide what to cook each and every day was the most difficult part, she had said. Radha hadn't believed her. How could someone not love something and still be so good at it? Or can they?\u0026nbsp; Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.\n\"Amma\"\nClunk. Clunk. Pause.\n\"Yes dear?\"\n\"Why don't you dance these days?\"\nWhen Radha had visited her grandparents’ ancestral home for her summer vacation last year, her Grandpa had shown her some childhood photos of Radha's mother. She had been surprised to find an album with photos of her mother in a traditional dancer's costume. Mother had never talked about it, and always found a way to wriggle out of conversations involving the album. Clunk. Clunk. \"Amma?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Sigh! You keep persevering, don't you? Just like your mother. Sleep. You need all the rest you can get. You will be going to school tomorrow, and you need to resume practicing. We don't have much time.\"\nRadha woke up to the sounds of the alarm clock, and pulled up the comforter to muffle her ears. She heard footsteps accompanied by jingling anklets. Her mother was marching into the room.\n“Radha, wake up! It is already late. How many more times do you want me to wake you up?”\nRadha turned her head sideways, so that one ear would be muffled by the pillow and the other by her comforter. She soon realized that the comforter was being pulled away.\n“5 minutes mom, please!”\n“RADHA!”, her mother’s voice raised perceptibly, “you are already late for school. You bunked yesterday too. Come on! Let me feel your neck.”\nRadha reluctantly let go of the comforter. Her mother placed her hands on Radha’s neck and let out a short scream.\n“Look! She’s still got a temperature. I told you to sleep yesterday, and you sat up late night watching taht stupid Hindi movie on TV. Now how will you go to school? You have already bunked a lot, and you need leave for next week too! You have no seriousness at all! You need to perform on 29th and there are hardly enough days left! And you are yet to perfect your Shabdam. Do you have any seriousness at all? Answer me!!”, her mother’s voice kept rising with each breathless word she uttered.\nDad sensed an impending commotion and had hurried into the room. He was now standing at the doorway with a half-buttoned shirt, trying to decide if it was safe to interrupt. Radha just stared back at her mother silently. She was getting anxious and felt hurt. She hated making mother angry, as mom would get completely unpredictable.\u0026nbsp; “I said ANSWER me! Is this how you take care of your health before an Arengetram? Do you know how much I am sacrificing so that you can dance? Where did you get the fever from? Did you get drenched in the rains? Mala told me that Meera had come home completely drenched on Thursday! Is that what you three did? Did you get drenched like pigs?”\nHer mother was clearly hysterical now, and there was no saying what she would do next. Dad entered the room and tried to interrupt.\n“Honey, look. Let her be. Please..”, but he was cut off.\n“You stay away from this!”, shouted mother. “You keep spoiling her all the time, and this is how she ends up. Look at her arrogance! She hasn’t answered yet. Did you or did you not get drenched in the rain?”\n\"What if I had?”, said Radha almost inaudibly.\n“What did you say?”, exclaimed her mother. \u0026nbsp;“What did she just say?”\n“I said what if I had!”, replied Radha.\nShe was louder now, but her voice was trembling. “\nWhy shouldn’t I get drenched, when Meera and Jenny are allowed to do it? Why should I always think about my Arengetram? Everyone else is allowed to go to the excursion, but I should stay home and practise! Why shouldn’t I watch a movie that I like on TV? All you want me to dance, dance, study and dance! Why? So that you can brag about me to your relatives and friends. ‘Wow! Your daughter dances so well. All credit must go to you’. That’s what you want to hear, no? You only think of your happiness! You are so selfish.”\nHer parents had never seen Radha raise her voice before. They were too stunned to speak for a couple of minutes. Mother was the first to recover.\nSlap!\n“How dare you talk back like that?”\nRadha had lost all her resolve by now. She slithered out of her bed weeping, and ran away from it. It was dad who reacted now, and tried to stop her. His daughter dodged him, ran into the bathroom, and locked the door in. He turned towards his wife, and she too was wiping out tears of her eyes.\n“Hey, why don’t you stay outside for a moment when I try talking to her? She is just getting anxious. Wait, you wanted to meet the caterers, right? Why don’t you go now, while I take care of her for a while?”\n“You want me to get out of my own house?”, she starred at him defiantly.\n“Please”\n\u0026nbsp;She noticed that he had turned slightly insistent, a tone which he rarely used, and nodded.\n“What about your office? You said you had a meeting”.\n“Yeah, but I can afford to skip it. I will call up Vinoth and tell him.”\n“Hello madam, would you please open the door? How long will you stay in that stinking place?”\nNo response.\n“Hey Radha, come on! Please come out. I have something for you here. Why don’t you see what it is?”\nA whimper. That gave him more confidence.\n“Hey, come out and I will tell you a nice story.”\nThe lock was unlatched from inside, and the door opened reluctantly.\n“Come on lady! What makes you so angry? Tell me”\n“I am sorry, pa! I was just tired, and wanted to sleep for a little while. Is she very angry with me?” He admired her maturity. She would grow up to be a wonderful woman.\n“Forget it dear. Come, lie down. Let me toast you some bread with Nuttela!”\nBy the time he finished toasting, she had moved to the couch and was watching another ‘stupid Hindi’ movie.\n“Aren’t you going to office daddy?”\n“Nope. I bunked too”, he smiled, “Thanks for giving me a great excuse to not-work today! We are going to watch this movie today. That’s Akshay Kumar, right?”\n“Look at you, so happy that at bunking office! Amma thinks you love your job”.\n“I do, but not always. One cannot love his work completely. I would like to stay home too. You know, it’s been long since I lay down in the bed for a whole day. I would like to play too, but I can’t. Not until you become a great dancer and start earning for me, allowing me to retire”.\nHe smile became gentler. She had been smiling too, unaware of where the conversation was being led to. It was too late when she realized, and she could only give him a look of mock anger when she did. “You like dancing, don’t you? You are so good at it. TVR sir called your mom last night, and he couldn’t stop bragging about you”.\n“Of course I do, pa. I was just tired”\nShe turned away her face almost imperceptibly, and her father let it pass.\n“Appa! Was amma a dancer too?”\nHe looked at her with contemplation, and seemed to weigh his options.\n“Yes, she was. Long back. At least, that’s what I have heard”\n“Why doesn’t she dance these days? And why doesn’t she even talk about it? She always gets angry with me when I ask”\nHe sighed. “I haven’t seen her dance too dear. But your Grandpa tells me that she was the best in these parts of the town. I believe him, for I have heard stories of how good she was”\n“But why does she hide it?”, Radha interrupted.\n“Well, it seems she was so passionate about her dance that she left her home and stayed at her dance school for a month before her Arengetram. Just a day before her big day, she lost her mother, your grandma. She blamed herself for not being with her mother when she breathed her last. Her Arengetram didn’t happen. Since then, she just gave up on dancing. Until we discovered that you can dance too, that is. And dance so well. Your Grandpa says that you are better than your mother was.” He realized that he had told her much more than he had intended. But he didn’t mind. Children have an uncanny ability to sense things that are being hidden from them. They are more mature than grown-ups imagine them to be. He was reminded of the occasion when he and her mother had tried to surprise her with a late night celebrations on her 10th birthday, only to realize that she had sensed it, and just played along with them to act surprised. It brought a smile to his face, and he turned towards her affectionately.\u0026nbsp; “But, it turns out that you might hate dancing. What a disappointment!”\n“Who said that?”, shrieked Radha, and then realized that her father had once again tricked her.\n“I like dancing too, pa. As soon as I finish eating this tasty toast, I will start practising”\n“What happened to your fever? Come on, show me your neck”, he unsuccessfully mimicked her mother.\n“Oh, that’s all right now appa”, she moved away with a sheepish smile of her own, “that went away at 08:40 as soon as the school prayer bell rang!”\nThe day started with much anxiety and expectations for all of them. Radha and her mom had barely slept the previous night. Radha's father had tried to convince them that they needed as much sleep as they could get before the big day, but to no avail. At some point of time in the night he had given up on them and went off to sleep. They were still awake when he woke up early in the morning, though they claimed that they had slept “a little”. The program was scheduled at 05:00 PM. Mom was busy all morning calling up different people and ensuring that there would be no hiccups. She kept striking off things from the big checklist she always carried with her, and kept adding new items to the list. An Arengetram is like an Indian marriage, and grandeur is a norm rather than an exception. TVR sir had traveled overnight to arrive at Thenkudi early in the morning, and was at their home by 9:30 AM, scoffing at suggestions to catch up on lost sleep. His mother’s health was deteriorating, and he would be able to leave her side for only a day. It had been decided that Radha wouldn’t do anything that would strain her before the performance. As the heroine of the day, she was not even allowed to move her feet an inch, and every single wish of hers was fulfilled. TVR sir tried to play along with all the pampering for a while, but he soon got into his own character. Sometime around the afternoon he started firing away instructions on what to do and what-not to do with the tone of a drill sergeant addressing his battalion. Radha found it all amusing, and was enjoying the day. Occasionally, she would experience flashes of what could be called as anxiety, but these moments were fleeting, and she was largely unaffected by it all. Haravahanam joined them towards the afternoon, clad in a silk Veshti and a dark blue shirt. He was a silent bundle of energy, and took over half of mother’s organizing tasks without speaking much.\u0026nbsp; Lunch was from Abirami mess, parcelled and delivered home. Some Kaju Katlis, Radha’s personal favourite, were distributed around as desserts. For once, Radha became excited and frantically gestured at her father to steal for her more sweets than she was entitled to, and her father surreptitiously complied. Mother had noticed, but she pretended not to. Cosmetic and stage decorative paraphernalia were bundled, along with return gifts for visitors and Guru-dakshina for TVR sir and the musical team. The luggage loaded was into TVR sir’s sedan, and Haravhanam joined him. Dad would drive Radha and her mother in their own car. They were leaving 3 hours before the event on mother’s insistence, despite the fact that all arrangements would be taken care of by the event management company they had hired. At the venue, Radha was left alone in the changing room beside the stage to rest for a while. She would be dancing for 3 hours on a trot, and she needed the rest.\u0026nbsp; Meera and Jenny had insisted that they reach the venue early too as they wanted to give “morale support” to Radha. They were accompanied by Meera’s father. Radha’s dad greeted Rajendran gladly. He had been tired of pretending to help with the arrangements, considering that he had nothing to do; everything had already been taken care of. So, the two men were left discussing varied stuff such as politics, early retirement and last night’s cricket match (which he had been forbade from watching). Meera and Jenny were mildly disappointed that Radha had momentarily napped off. They occupied themselves by helping their friend’s mother, who had finally realized that she had nothing to be anxious about, and that things were running smoothly. They were huddled in the second changing room, inserting generic thank you notes into envelopes for visitors. “So Meera, how are your dance classes going on?”\n“Fine aunty”\n“What fine? Her teacher keeps scolding her for not dancing properly!”, interjected Jenny mockingly. Meera starred angrily at Jenny.\n“What to do aunty! Try as I might, I am not able to perfect dancing.”\nMeera was learning Bharatanattiyam too. She was a fine dancer with high standards to live up to, probably because of her best buddy.\n“It is funny aunty. I really like to dance, but I am not great at it. Radha keeps saying that she hates to dance, but she is so very good at it!”\n“Shhh”, interjected Jenny.\n“What do you mean, Meera? Does Radha tell you that she ‘hates’ dancing?”\nMeera had realized her folly, and stayed silent.\n“Nothing like that aunty”, said Jenny, “this idiot is just jealous. She loves dancing, though she occasionally gets tired of her long practice sessions”\n“Jenny, look here. Answer me honestly. I won’t get angry. Does she, or does she not hate dancing?” They didn’t reply, but the looks on their faces were enough for Radha’s mother.\nRadha’s Bhoomanjali and Aalarapu went like a charm, and by the time she was doing her Jathiswaram the sections of the audience who had never seen her dance were convinced that the buzz that was around this girl all around the town was deserved. Radha danced with the confidence of a gambler who has no stakes in what he is doing, and she was mesmerising. There was a bit of imperiousness in her, a sub-conscious recognition of her own genius that was carried to every inch of the arena through her movements. Her feet were nimble, and her eyes came in contact with every member of the audience, almost intimidatingly. TVR sir just starred at her with an inscrutable expression. If he was pleasantly surprised by Radha’s sure-footedness, the virtuoso made sure not to show it. However, he leaned forward indiscernibly when Radha started her Shabdam. He was sure that her Tandavam, the masculine side of the dance, would be perfect. But her Lasya -- the feminine movements -- usually fell short of Radha’s own high standards. She was surprisingly good today; graceful and effeminate while playing the part of the Gopikas. The only minor hurdle was when the sound system failed briefly, but Radha had carried on as if she didn’t need the music at all.\u0026nbsp; When Radha bowed down to a thunderous standing ovation at the end of her performance, TVR sir allowed a smile to enter his face. The smile was replaced by a look of pride when he was called on the stage. As Radha’s nattuvanar -- the Guru -- he was reserved the highest honours. TVR sir took the opportunity to announce to the audience that he would not be teaching anymore. Radha could not have given him a more fitting farewell. As Radha fell down to his feet to seek his blessings, he stood her up and whispered that she had more to achieve, more challenges to overcome, and that she should not get complacent. An Arengetram is only the beginning of a dancer’s career, he explained. Radha reacted with a flurry of detached nods. As she left the stage her parents were waiting to greet her -- mom with tear-filled eyes, and dad with candy-filled hands. Meera and Jenny were there too. For Radha, the rest of the day was a blur. Many hands held hers to congratulate her, and a lot of them remarked that she must be proud of her achievement. She had an inkling that this must indeed be an extremely proud and happy moment. But all she felt was a numbness. She looked around at the faces of everyone she loved. Mom was the happiest of them all. She glanced at dad, TVR sir, her thatha who had come down from their village solely to watch her perform, Meera, Jenny, her teachers including Balki sir who for once was not asking her about her assignments, Kumar anna, Raja anna. Almost everyone she knew was around her, and every one of them seemed happy. Could this be happiness, the ability to make everyone around, the people you love, happy? Is this how happiness feels?\u0026nbsp; Her mother was flooded around with people too. A child-prodigy is as much an effort of the parent as the child. Other parents looked at her with awe, and a lot of them were seen orbiting around her until they were pushed away by others who were waiting for their turns; as if they hoped to be infected by the ability to raise a genius. All the attention she was getting made mom feel like an undeserving celebrity. Someone started shouting out questions at her too -- as if she was an actress at a press conference. “My daughter practices for 3 hours each day. Is that enough? For how many hours per day does Radha practice?”. “What sacrifices did you have make to achieve this?”. “Did you have to disconnect the movie channels from your TV to keep her focused”. “Where does she get so much stamina from? What is her diet?”. She ignored them all with an outwardly polite smile.\u0026nbsp; She was besides Radha now when someone called out,\n“what will she do next? Who will be her dance teacher now?”\nSomething stirred in her, and she turned to face the lady who had asked question. She quickly glanced at Radha, who had been stoic in receiving all congratulatory messages, and caught her eye. She noticed the fleeting change of expression in Radha’s eyes that vanished quickly, as if she was trying to hide it, and held her daughter's eyes as she spoke.\n“I have no idea. It is for Radha to decide”, she said, smiling at Radha. --END-- ","date":"12 August 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-prodigy/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Prodigy","type":"posts"},{"content":" “ONE LITTLE KITTEN, TWO BIG CATS”, wrote Mala ma'am in big, bold letters on the blackboard, reading her words aloud. The letters curled towards the right, in contrast to the upright letters of the words “HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY” written in bigger and bolder letters at the top of the blackboard. Rajaji Primary school was in its first post-lunch session on an unusually hot February day. As the students in class I-B repeated the words after her, Rishi suppressed a yawn and joined in at “..TWO..”, stressing the words in an unnecessarily loud and out-of-tune voice. His hands felt under the desk, grabbing one from the last few toffees left in a plastic cover. He unwrapped it as noiselessly as possible, surreptitiously popped the toffee into his mouth, and pushed back the wrapper under the desk. “Psst! Psst!”. He turned around to the outraged pouts of Karan and Rohit, who were sitting behind him at the next desk. Their palms were outstretched, entreating him to share his toffees. His hesitation lost to their insistence, and he passed on a couple grudgingly. “SIX SAD SEALS, SEVEN SILLY SEAGULLS”, shouted his classmates as his mind wandered to the morning session. Rohit and Karan had taken alternate turns in accompanying him to distribute the toffees all around the school. He remembered nervously entering the fifth standard class room, where Anandhi ma'am was teaching Science. “Come in, my child”, she said looking up from her book. “Ah Chocolates! Do we have a birthday baby here?”, she asked as he entered alone, unable to persuade Rohit to join him.\n“I am g..going to have a baby next week, mam”, he stammered, doing his best to avoid eye contact with the tall, big seniors in the class fixated on him.\nThe complete class sniggered as Anandhi mam looked up in surprise.\n“I am going to have a baby sister next week, mam”, he hastily corrected himself.\n“Fantastic. A cute baby sister for a shy boy. What are you going to call her?”\n“Nithya, mam”\n“Nithya. Wonderful name! I believe it means everlasting. God bless her with a long life”, she said as she grabbed a handful of chocolates and stuffed them in her shiny red purse.\n--- “TWELVE FAT FLEAS” continued Mala mam. Rishi concentrated on chewing the caramel toffee. They didn’t taste as good as those foreign-chocolates his dad had brought from Abu Dhabi a few months back. He missed his father, who stayed with Raju and his mom only for a month every year. He pictured himself riding on the bike with his appa, seated over the petrol tank, pretending as if he was controlling the bike. He longed for the sweaty smell of his father. His father had just left back to Abu for Dhabi work, and Rishi knew that it would be long before his father came back again for the next yearly break. ”You would be in second standard. A grown-up. Study well, and take care of your mother and the baby”, appa had told before leaving.\nRishi looked forward to growing up. He would ride around in his own bike, handling the bike with one hand while talking on the phone with the other, just like his father. His father had brought his mother an android phone last time, and he had promptly installed Angry Birds and Subway Surfers. Amma always sought his help to do this or that with the phone. But apparently, he was too young to have his own phone. “Soon, Rishi. Soon!”, he told himself.\n--- “FIFTEEN DONKEYS WITH FIFTEEN TAILS”, wrote Mala mam and turned around. She was interrupted by a noise from outside. Grateful for the distraction, the children turned towards the door. Rishi let out a short yelp as he recognized the tall bearded man in a blue shirt and jeans outside as his own maternal uncle. “Raghu mama!”, he almost exclaimed, and his face broke into a spontaneous grin. He eagerly watched as his uncle grimly passed on a letter to Mala mam. She glanced at it, and quietly motioned at Rishi to leave with him. Rishi grabbed his bag, stood up, took a step forward, realized he had forgotten something in his excitement, doubled back and pulled out the toffee cover. Half-a-dozen empty wrappers flew out of the desk as Rohit and Karan stifled their laughter. Rishi didn’t mind them though. He had half-a-day off, while Karan and Rohit would have to endure two continuous maths periods followed by an anxious English hour handled by the stern Simion Clark sir. --- Raghu uncle didn’t like him sitting on the petrol tank; so Rishi had to sit behind his savior-from-drudgery and hug him tight. He momentarily released his hands to wave a goodbye to the friendly watchman anna, and had to quickly hold his uncle’s waist to regain balance as the engine revved up. “Mama, where are we going?”, he shouted above the noise, asking the question for the thirteenth time since they had left the class.\nThe last time his uncle had relieved him from school this way, they had lied that their mother was unwell and gone to watch a movie starring Vijay in theatre. After the movie, Raghu uncle had treated him to a Softy cone ice cream. It had been great fun. “Are you taking me to a movie?”, he asked hopefully.\nHis uncle shushed, and rode on silently.\nAfter what seemed like a long time, Raghu uncle parked his bike before a large, concrete, morose looking building. A lot of people were moving in and out of the entrance, and a large number of them were nurses in white gowns. He read the board in front of the hospital with some difficulty: “Jeya Hospitals”. Rishi hated hospitals. His mother often took him along for check-ups, and he felt uncomfortable seeing people hastening around. He was also scared of doctors, who wouldn’t think twice about using an injection on you if you annoy them. The last thing he wanted was to take half-a-day off from school and spend it in a dreary hospital. They walked past the reception to a waiting lobby, took the stairs to the second floor, and crossed a row of rooms to reach a door marked as “1906”. Raghu uncle knocked once, and opened the door. Rishi was surprised to see his paternal grandparents; his patti half out of the chair to open the door, and his thatha sitting as he always did, indifferent to the surroundings. Mom rarely got along with his grandpa and grandma. His mother herself was in the lying in the patient’s bed, craning her neck out to see the door. As soon as she spotted him, she ignored the protests of Raghu uncle and sat up on the bed with difficulty, extending her arms to him. Rishi held her, and she hugged him fiercely. The visibly embarrassed boy freed himself from her grasp. His features unconsciously started twisting into a frown of annoyance -- he had told her about a thousand times that he didn’t like her showing such affection in public – but he remembered that she was bed-ridden, and softened a little. He lied to his mother’s “did you eat your lunch properly?”, whilst inserting both his hands into his pant pockets. His uncle had always chided that gesture as being adult like, and Raju wanted to handle this like an adult would.\n“And how are you, patti”, he asked turning towards his grandmother.\n“What did the doctor say?”, Raghu uncle cut in loudly.\n“The latest scan results have confirmed it. It has been like this for f..four weeks”, his mother’s voice broke.\n“They have arranged for the operation on 29th, day after tomorrow”, his grandmother added.\nThe room drifted off into an uneasy silence. Seeing his mother lying dormant on a bed caused an uncomfortable feeling in Rishi’s stomach. Try as hard as he could, he couldn’t remember a day with his mother not standing at the door of their house, anxiously waiting for him as he walked home from the school bus. Her first question would always be, “did you eat your lunch?”. She would then open his Spider-man tiffin box, and berate him when she found the left-overs in it. She didn’t check his tiffin box today. Instead, she asked him if he wanted to lie down. He protested, but Raghu uncle had already started clearing the spare bed to make space for him. He also made a makeshift pillow using, appropriately, Rishi’s books; covering them with a towel. Rishi lied down, and soon drifted off into a nap. When he woke up, it felt as if he had slept for many hours. He was surprised to find himself on the hospital bed, and it took a while for him to register why he was there. He slowly sat up. His mother was asleep, his grandfather was reading the latest issue of a Tamil magazine, and his grandmother seemed to be murmuring silent prayers. “Where is Raghu mama?”, he asked.\nHe had overestimated the strength of his voice, and the words fell flat at the foot of his bed. He tried again.\n“Patti, where is Raghu mama?”\nHis grandfather opened his eyes wearily. His grandmother starred at him blankly before answering him.\n“He has gone to the airport.”\n“But why?”.\n“What why? To pick up your father”, she stated with an air of obviousness.\n“WHAT!? Is Appa coming home?”, shrieked Rishi.\nForgetting his resolve to act like an adult, he leapt out of the bed and started going around in circles play-acting a bike ride. “Drrr..Drr..dududududu.. Durrrrr”.\nThe noise woke up his mother.\n“Rishi!Rishi!”\n“Keen Kin! Keen Kin! Keen kin! Drrr..dudu dud dud du”\n“Rishi, stop!”, his mother had to shout in anguish to make herself heard.\n“Nithya is dead. Your baby sister died inside my stomach. They are going to operate me tomorrow to take her out”, she said.\nRishi stopped abruptly, without bringing the gears of his bike to neutral. He had looked forward to playing with Nithya. He had imagined showing her off to his friends, teaching her to wear a sticker pottu and protecting her from Rowdies like his favourite movie heros. He had wanted to teach her to play Subway Surfers, and had visualized her watching him with amazement as the high scores tumbled. What will he say to Anandhi madam when she asks him about his cute sister? What will Karan and Rohit say to him? Would they tease him as if it was his mistake? Had he distributed so many chocolates for nothing? That reminded him, and he quickly glanced at the unshaped chocolate cover which protruded out of his backpack, reassuring himself with relief that it was still there. It then occurred to him that he had bunked his school. Would Clark sir ask him to stand up on the bench tomorrow? He imagined standing up on the bench, when that bespectacled Raji pointed and laughed at him. The idea made him profoundly sad, and tears poured out of his eyes spontaneously. His mother noticed his anguish, and beckoned at him. “Oh, don’t cry dear child! Please don’t. I love you so much. I thank God for you! Please God, don’t let him cry.”, she hugged him once again. This time, he let her. After being held for a few minutes, he tentatively tugged at her saree.\n“Mommy!”\n“Yes dear”\n“Can I have your phone?”\nHis mother hesitated, and gave him a weak smile, asking him to carefully take it from her green handbag lying on the spare bed, and not to disturb anything else from the bag. “Or else, better still, bring me the bag and I will get it for you”. Rishi occupied himself with the mobile phone. He didn’t know how much time passed, before someone knocked the door of their room. Everyone looked up in expectation. The door opened inwards, and a tall muscular figure wearing an old jeans pant and a gray shirt stepped in, its disheveled hair blocking the numerals ‘1906’. “APPA!”, Rishi shouted excitedly, jumping out of the bed and running towards the door. His father responded with a weak smile, and offered his hand as a greeting. Rishi hung on to the hand and tried to climb up. His father almost lost his balance, and his patti reproved him for his mischief. “How are you, my boy?”, Rishi’s father asked tiredly.\n“I am fine dad. How are you?”\n“Fi..”\n“Did you bring those cracking chocolates for me? And the remote controlled helicopter? Where are your bags?”\nHis father looked at Rishi, and tears welled up in his eyes. Raghu -- who had stepped in behind him -- gripped his shoulders, and patted him on the back, whilst meeting Rishi’s eyes with an admonishing stare.\nRishi was baffled, and his face fell. He understood that he won’t be having a baby sister, and he had wept for it too. But he had never seen his father cry. Was his father not glad to see him? He never understood these adults and their mood-swings. He wished he could grow-up soon, and be like them. Nothing would make him happier.\nOr so he thought.\nSoon, Rishi. Soon.\n-END- ","date":"29 July 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/nithya/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Nithya","type":"posts"},{"content":" Watchmen by Alan Moore\nMy rating: 5 of 5 stars\n\"It doesn't require genius to see that America has problems that need tackling. An' it takes a moron to think that they are small enough for clowns like you to handle\" \u0026nbsp;- The Comedian I recently came across this engaging Podcast conversation between the controversial author Sam Harris and history buff Dan Carlin. Among other things, Sam Harris brings up the elevated threat levels in today's World thanks to terrorism. In his considered response, Dan Carlin proposes that it is only our perception of threat that has increased, and not the threat itself. He reminisces on growing up during the height of cold war in the USA, where people lived in constant fear of a nuclear showdown between two superpowers. A manufactured fear, implies Dan Carlin. Imagining this fear helps us understand the bleakness of Alan Moore's Watchmen better. Watchmen is an epic, ambitious attempt, spanning a time period of more than sixty years from the end of the first World War to the fag end of the cold war in the mid 1980s. The backdrop is in an alternate history where the presence of Watchmen seems to have affected events subtly. Richard Nixon continues as the President of the USA, with a mention of a suspicious accident that kills two Washington Post reporters (there is a hint that one of the Watchmen, The Comedian, was involved in this, but it is up to us to draw our own conclusions). To say Watchmen is dense would be an understatement. The writing and the artwork is crammed with details, and the radical temporal and spatial shifts demand unwavering attention from the readers. Dave Gibbons adds a lot with his art and the arresting visuals enhance the story. Reading the Watchmen is like watching a movie at times. Despite the predominantly dark tone of the actual plot-line (\"Life's so fragile, a successful virus clinging to a speck of mud, suspended in endless nothing\"), Watchmen comes with a supplementary reading at the end of each chapter where Alan Moore shows off his range of writing styles. The supplements range from an academic report on birds to a staunchly right-wing newspaper account, and these supplements add a lot to the Watchmen universe. There is even a comic-inside-comic about a pirate ship that mirrors the narrative of, and is much darker than, the story. The primary purpose of Alan Moore in writing the Watchmen was to subvert the superhero genre, and he pulls this off spectacularly. The Watchmen are unlike any set of superheroes we have come across. Most of them are neither super nor heroic. One fights crime to escape from his tormented life, and another to escape from his dreary life. One fights crime for the popularity it entails, and another for reasons no one can fathom. One, the most powerful of them all, is an accidental superhero and would rather be somewhere else (Mars, maybe). Their political positions vary too. Rorschach's journal has an entry that reads \"New social evils emerge everyday : promiscuity, drugs, campus subversions\"; a stance that is relevant for the far right even today. However the central idea of Watchmen is in elucidating the fascism of a superhero. Will you make decisions that affect millions of people without their consent because you think it is for their own good? What if you are wrong? An additional theme that constantly runs throughout is the incompetence of current political systems to keep people happy. If you think such abstract ideas are irrelevant today, you just have to listen to the very same podcast I mentioned earlier (and I have linked below the post). Sam Harris and Dan Carlin disagree on how injustice in a foreign country must be dealt with by the USA, and the parallels are uncanny (At this point, I must confess that I don't love Sam Harris. I had written about him earlier - Science, Morality and Sam Harris. On the other hand, I like what I have heard by Dan). On the downside, if you try explaining the plot of Watchmen to someone who hasn't read it (or watched the movie), you are likely to struggle with it. The scope of Watchmen is so big that Moore falters a bit while dealing with the actual central plot-line. Additionally, the characters do not connect with us emotionally. I have never been a big fan of the superhero genre, and the tiny elements of Watchmen that actually deal with the stuff superheros do -- saving people and fighting enemies -- were underwhelming. I would say that these are trivial complaints. Alan Moore is clear on what he sets out to do, and he succeeds. Watchmen was the first graphic novel I read, and I am sold. The narrative technique, the level of detailing, and the moral questions raised by Alan Moore make Watchmen a very satisfying read. The Watchmen is more for the mind that for the heart.

There is even an unverified claim by the Russian Government that the chief of ISIS, the Caliph\u0026nbsp;Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been killed. Will we soon, thankfully, see the end of the Islamic State (IS)? Or will we have another version of the horror and terror that was unleashed in the Middle East? Graeme Wood thinks this is not the end, and to comprehend why, he takes us into the minds of a few of ISIS's supporters in his brilliant book The Way of Strangers : Encounters with the Islamic State. Apart from understanding the motives of ISIS, we get a fair idea of Islam as a religion, and the various divisions within it. We start before the advent of Islamic State in the current form with Hesham Elashry, an Egyptian tailor who lived in Brooklyn and grew up without much of an interest towards religion, until he stumbled upon the Blind Sheik's (The Blind Sheik is a prominent Iman currently under arrest in the USA for jihadist propaganda) sermons. Having converted to Salafism, one of the strictest forms of Islam, Hesham meets Graeme Wood in Egypt and attempts to seduce him into the religion. Hesham is not technically a part of the Islamic State as far as we know, but he exemplifies perfectly the mindset that would lead people to support the IS once the Caliphate is declared. Graeme Wood's narration during this episode is so gripping that this could be a John Le Carre novel, complete with a victim in the form of a non-suspecting Japanese woman caught in unfathomable circumstances. We then travel to Australia to meet Musa Cerantino, the centerpiece of the book as well as of an earlier long form article by Graeme Wood for The Atlantic. Musa Cerantino was, at one point of time, among the three most prolific online recruiters for the IS, apart from doubling up as their unofficial English language spokesperson. Astonishingly, Musa is normal in most ways, so much so that Wood forms a sort of friendship with him. Through the longest chapter in the book, we learn Musa's views on why a Bay'a, or fealty, to the Islamic State is the duty of every true Muslim. Some investigative journalism leads Wood to Yahya, an American who is just a loser in the eyes of his parents, but turns out to be one of the most influential characters within the IS. Though we do not get to meet Yahya, we get a complete character sketch by meeting people around him and exploring the circumstances that led him to make the decisions he made. Yahya's case proves that the Islamic State attracts many despite their being from geopolitically and economically stable backgrounds. Apart from a few other characters, Graeme Wood then meets a couple of prominent American Muslim scholars who, despite their fierce disagreement with each other, vehemently condemn the Islamic State. Contrary to the perception of most outsiders, Islam is a religion of logical reasoning, or Qiyas. Reading Graeme Wood's books made me realize that Islam is one of the few religions with really devout followers in current day society. A lot of time is spent on interpreting the religious texts and deriving the right way to live. If you buy into a certain premise, you can reach a conclusion that may sound horrifying to outsiders, but is still logically sound. The premise on which the logic is derived is often what causes factionalism within Islam, and through Graeme Wood's book we get to meet Salafis, Wahabbis, Sufis, Dhahiris and Quiet Salafis, among others. Wood's contention is that if you follow the premise of a devout Salafi who thinks Jihad is okay, it would be extremely tough to not end up supporting the Islamic State. Of course, Graeme Wood is conscious that this is not the only reason for people to join Islamic State. There is always a geopolitical angle, an economic angle, a psychological reason. There is also an apocalyptic perspective, luring people by prophesying that in the near-future, \"The earth will suffer a drought - a third of the planet will go without rain one year, and two-thirds the next. We will live in a age of miracles, both counterfeit and real; of inconceivable suffering, bloodshed, and tribulations; of global war waged with tools ranging from sabers to thermonuclear weapons. Those who survive - Muslims and not - will wish for death.\" However, Graeme Wood strongly disagrees with the view that the IS is just \"an army of psychopaths and self-dramatizing losers.\", pointing out that many followers of Islamic State are more well-versed in the reading of the religious texts than the average Muslim. There is also a commentary on research focused on religion. While Wood appreciates Princeton University for their extensive research on Jihad, he laments the lack of such work elsewhere. He disagrees with Karl Marx's opinion that \"Religion is always reducible to a material explanation\", and argues that religion itself is a prime motive in many cases. ISIS, he implies, is not the exploitation of religion to meet political ends. It is rather the exploitation of politics to meet religious ends. And he adds that a secular outlook would inhibit us from seeing this truth. This is not to imply that Graeme Wood is anti-Islamic at any point of time. He seems to have an extensive knowledge of Islamic texts, and seems to be respected enough by Muslim scholars (at least the ones portrayed in the book). His point is simply that a lot ideological arguments of an entity like ISIS can only be answered with ideological debate, and this can be done only once we concede that ISIS is an Islamic group. In his own words, \"Since 2012, tens of thousands of men, women and children have migrated to a theocratic state, under the belief that migration is a sacred obligation and that the state's leader is the worldly successor of the last and greatest of prophets. If religious scholars see no role for religion in a mass movement like this, then they see no role for religion in the world.\" Graeme Wood is a terrific writer. The writing has a journalistic economy of words, and The Way of Strangers is engaging throughout. Apart from a command of English that made me reach for the dictionary every few minutes to look up \u0026nbsp;meanings, he seems to be versed in Arabic, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, and probably other languages he has not revealed to us about. This mastery of languages probably plays a large role in the fact that Graeme Wood is able to connect with a variety of people and get their unencumbered views. He also has a good sense of humour, and inappropriately for such a book, I laughed out loud a few times. Especially when he describes how a Japanese propensity to punctuality irritated a potential ISIS supporter enough to move out of ISIS region. The one complaint I had with the book is of a typographical nature. The notes and references which provide essential insights are placed at the end of the book and it was extremely inconvenient shifting from the main narrative to the notes section. I would personally prefer these in the form of \u0026nbsp;foot-notes. On the other popular complaint that Graeme Wood does not visit the ISIS territory at all, I wouldn't say I missed it a lot. Islam is the most popular religion in the World, and it is still the least understood among the non-practitioners. The two major narratives surrounding the religion are, to use Graeme Wood's words, that \"Islam is essentially \u0026nbsp;harsh and murderous\", or that \"Islam is a religion of peace\". Graeme Wood convinces us that both these views are wrong, and when major global decisions are made with either of these view-points, it would turn counter-productive and act as fodder for groups such as the Islamic State. And the sad thing is that, as an idea, Islamic State is probably not dead yet, at least in the minds of many Muslims. He points out regions which are ripe for another Islamic State (prominent among them is Mindano in Philippines). \"Wherever there is grievance, savagery can be sown. Wherever there is savagery, it can be used and exploited. Wherever it can be exploited, the nightmare can endure\", he says. Humanity should work towards reducing grievances on one hand. On the other hand, as one Islamic State advocate puts, \"the fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason to hate you will not case to exist until you embrace Islam\". This can be curtailed only by the scholars of Islam. It is not a fight the outsiders, the infidels, can win.

However, this city's splendour is contingent on the fact that a single child is kept imprisoned in a basement cell in constant misery. Would you chose to live in such a city, where the \"greatest good\" is at the cost of a single unfortunate human's misery? Can a society even aim to become something other than Omelas. India is accused of many things; but never of being Utopia. At least not in the present (some maintain that ancient India was the greatest-everything ever). India is not Omelas. However India, like probably every other country, has a basement cell. In The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, Arundhathi Roy doggedly focuses on this basement cell, where we have imprisoned more, many more, than one single child. The Ministry of Utmost Happiness is set in Delhi and Kashmir for the most part, and deals with the fringes of our society. A transgender woman caught in a man's body; a woman who swears, smokes beedis and refuses to wear make-up; a Kashmiri who has crossed over to the other side and takes arms against India; and an enterprising Dalit who thinks one fringe is better than another, and thereby calls himself Saddaam Hussein. The canvas is epic, as Arundhathi Roy attempts to deal with multiple issues and to tie them up with the modern history of India. She succeeds at times, but falters at most. Her politics and anger seep through her writing, even at the rare moments when she seems to be attempting to subdue them. As a fiction, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness is underwhelming. As a call for our empathy, it will polarize people, but needs to be read by Indians who are too proud of their country to not see its many flaws. Arundhathi Roy's political position is well-known, and she has been praised, awarded, hounded, abused and threatened for her views. The God of Small Things, which brought her to limelight, is a political book too. However beneath the politics it had an emotional story that we could empathize with. In The Ministry of Utmost Happiness though, Arundhathi Roy's stance is clear - fiction is an excuse to get across her ideas. The attack on political right is relentless. On Brahmins, the upper class of India (and one to which I belong), she says they \"wear their sacred threads inside their safari suits, and their sacred ponytails dangling down the inside of their vegetarian skulls.\" With her powerful narration, she makes a Ram-Leela celebration feel like a horrific congregation of right-wing goons. India feels like Afghanistan under the Taliban in Khaled Hosseni's A Thosand Splendid Suns. She attacks Indira Gandhi by name, and goes on ridicule and mock modern politicians and contemporary figures by symbolism. Vajpayee (the\"lisping poet\"), Advani, Anna Hazare (\"newest show in the town\"), Arvind Kejriwal (\"raging, almost uncontrollable, tornado of terrifying righteousness\"), Manmohan Singh (\"puppet\"), and even Chetan Bhagath (through a reference to a book titled \"What young India really wants\") - no one's safe. The most choicest insults are of course reserved to Narendra Modi (\"Lala\"). Arundhathi Roy picks on most forms of activism in a scene set in the Delhi Anti-Corruption protests with a tone conveying that every form of activism other than hers is inferior. She almost spares Muslims. At one point, one of the lead characters says that \"We Muslims are motherfuckers too, just like everyone else.. our name is in mud already\", but in general she sympathizes with the conditions of Muslims in India. It is probably because Arundhathi Roy feels that Muslims are already disgraced enough in the current climate. What we get instead is a first hand glimpse of Muslim culture and Urdu language. We learn about the equanimity of the Mughal King Muhammad Shah Rangila. Even dead Muslims are better than dead Hindus in her World (\"If they were recognizably Muslim they were buried in unmarked graves that disappeared over time and contributed to the richness of the soil and the unusual lushness of the old trees\"). She refers to Kashmir as outside India. We do get a bit of an opposing perspective through the character of Biplab Dasgupta (who thinks, \"We have our troubles, our terrible moments, yes, but these are only aberrations. I feel a rush of anger at those grumbling intellectuals and professional dissenters who constantly carp about this great country. Frankly, they can do it only because they are allowed to. And they are allowed to because, for all our imperfections, we are a genuine democracy.\"), but the narrative is overwhelmingly against this view. Now, I am not saying that these are problems that need not be discussed. The rise of the far-right in India is a dangerous sign. Dalits are still ill-treated and rarely considered as equals. We have destroyed our environment to favour corporates and cities. Kashmir is a glaring mess which is becoming worse, and most of the Indians outside Kashmir are frightfully happy to ignore the brutality of Indian Army. However, Arundhathi Roy's views are completely unsympathetic to the idea of India as a country. She refers to the violence in India as the \"Apparition whose presence we in India are all constantly and acutely aware of had suddenly surfaced, snarling, from the deep, and had behaved exactly as we expected it to.\" She feels that \"Normality in our part of the World is a bit like a boiled egg: its humdrum surface conceals at its heart a yolk of egregious violence.\" \u0026nbsp; I sat-up when we see things (for a very brief while) from the perspective of a Tamil soldier. We learn that this soldier is a Dalit too, and we witness the cruelty with which the upper caste treat him back home. As a work of fiction, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness falters often. The two main narratives of Anjum and Tilotamma do not connect seamlessly. There are some glaring logical oversights. A wanted activist (or terrorist, depending on the way you look at it) moving around in disguise carries a photograph of his family with him. Miss Jeban the second stays in a house with Tilotemma which is conveniently \"sound-proofed\", so that the neighbors do not suspect anything. The whole episode of Anjum's travel to Gujarat is obviously force-fitted so that Arundhathi Roy can describe the 2002 riots (which she does very effectively). Anjum's struggle as a trans-gender is dealt with extremely well, for a while. Once Anjum grows up, she just becomes another character and we do not see much of the practical difficulties such a person faces in India. The God of Small Things had a small element of magical realism. Such moments are present in The Ministry of Utmost Happiness too (\"Clouds stopped drifting in the sky, birds froze in mid-flight\"), but are few and far between. The book still works despite all this because Arundhathi Roy is a phenomenal writer. She is one of those rare writers who can afford to break all structural rules of fiction, and still ably engage the readers. Her writing is dreamy and trippy at her best, and borders on absurd, but almost always stops on genius. There is no structure to her narration, but this unpredictability adds to the fun. The politics of Arundhathi Roy is the politics of Tilotemma, who even remarks that \"I would like to write one of those sophisticated stories in which even though nothing much happens there's a lot to write about. That can't be done in Kashmir. It's not sophisticated; what happens here. There's too much blood for good literature.\" Arundhathi Roy has clearly not set out to create great literature. She just wants to get her messages across. In many an Indian's minds, Kashmir is a black-and-white issue with terrorists and patriotic soldiers. The Ministry of Utmost Happiness inverses this, with the black being the white and the white being the black - a war between innocent civilians forced to defend themselves and cruel, psychotic fascists. The truth is most definitely a mixture of both narratives - a shade of gray. If India were a woman, Roy does not consider her to be an attractive one. She writes on India's modernization, \"Her new masters wanted to hide her knobby, varicose veins under imported fishnet stockings, cram her withered tits into saucy padded bras and jam her aching feet into pointed high-heeled shoes. They wanted her to swing her stiff old hips and re-route the edges of her grimace upwards into a frozen, empty smile. It was the summer Grandma became a whore.\" Bleak and pessimistic. Arundhathi Roy's work would be appreciated far and widely in the Western World where human rights activists would forget that the platform they speak from is one of unparalleled imperialistic and colonial crimes. That is not to say that Arundhathi Roy's views can be ignored at home. She is one of the greatest writers of this generation, and her political views are based on a lot of truth. However it is up to us to gleam the empathy from her writing with a holistic understanding. After all, each country has its own Omelas-basement, and each of us need to work towards eliminating the misery of the people trapped in this basement.\u0026nbsp; View all my reviews on Goodreads ","date":"19 June 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-arundhathi-roys-the-ministry-of-utmost-happiness/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Arundhathi Roy's The Ministry of Utmost Happiness","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Guide by R.K. Narayan\nMy rating: 5 of 5 stars\nR.K.Narayan is the direction I would like to take in my own writing. Concise, clear and unobtrusive language that tells simple, timeless stories. In The Guide, we meet Raju who -- fresh from serving a two-year jail term -- is mistaken to be a wise and learned sadhu. This third person narrative interweaves with a first person narrative of Raju's past, where he tells us the story of his life leading to him being jailed. As the two narratives progress, we recognize that there is a pattern to everything Raju does, and that his nature makes him eternally a Guide. Raju is an instrument whose purpose is to serve other people and to give others something they lack. As he remarks, \"It is written on the brow of some that they shall not be left alone. I am one such\". This giving is literal when Raju is a shopkeeper catering to the passengers who use the Malgudi railway station. However it takes an abstract turn as he progresses to a guide and earns the moniker 'Railway Raju'. His purpose now is to give information, and he does not hesitate to make them up when he is not sure. As he remarks, 'If I had the inclination to say \"I don't know what you are talking about\", my life would \u0026nbsp;have taken a different turn'. Later on, he would be required to give Rosie the freedom to enjoy her art. And finally, he is a giver of spiritual peace and comfort to the villagers around an abandoned temple. Twice, Raju deviates from his purpose and succumbs to selfish motives driven by lust and money. And he falters each time. The edition I read has an added bonus in the form of a wonderful introduction by Michael Gora who seems well-versed in R.K.Narayan's works. As Gora puts it, he has a \"language that seems mastered, but not fought with\". The focus is always on what is happening. Physical descriptions are rare. Even when Raju lusts after Rosie, we learn less about her features than about her dancer's pose. His style is a major factor in making The Guide a gripping read. Apart from Raju; Rosie, Marco, Raju's mother are all well-etched characters. Most of R.K.Narayan's humour is derived from caricatures of other characters, especially of the society as a whole. The general public in The Guide are simpletons with hilarious quirks. Unlike many Indian novels, the tribulations this protagonist faces are his own doing. There is no effect of the prevailing political situation or macro-level factors on Raju. He is clearly born in a family that is not very well-off, as we can see from the descriptions of their simple and barely functional house. However R.K.Narayan never mentions this explicitly, and the lack of wealth in Raju's household does not limit his potential to achieve what he sets out to do. There is a school of thought that argues that this apolitical nature of fiction does not do justice to the real backdrop. Compare this style of writing with that of Salmaan Rushdie or Arundathi Roy, where the settings cause chaotic effects of the lives of the characters. In my personal opinion though, both kinds of writers are necessary, and add their own value to literature. P.G.Wodehouse wrote more than a hundred books without a political backdrop, and he even committed a political gaucherie that resulted in him being accused of being a Nazi spy. The timelessness of R.K.Narayan's stories enable us to focus more on the characters themselves, and why they act the way they do. Reading The Guide, I was once again reminded that R.K.Narayan's simplicity is a facade hiding complex thoughts and emotions.

To achieve moral awakening required a force outside human race.\" Chinese science fiction author Liu Cixin's first book of the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy -- The Three-Body Problem -- begins with a bang. In the height of the cultural revolution in China (around the late 1960s), most of Ye Wenjie's family is hounded by the students of The Red Guard for being intellectuals. A dazed and damaged Ye is offered an opportunity to redeem herself in the eyes of the communist decision makers by contributing to a top-secret Governmental science project. What she discovers there can potentially change the fate of humanity. Forty years later, Wang Miao, a scientist working on cutting edge nanotechnology is contacted by the police to help solve the mysterious deaths and suicides of renowned scientists all over the country. Meanwhile in a third narrative, Wang Miao discovers an immersive Virtual Reality game called The Three-Body Problem that is strangely addictive, and somehow seems connected to the bizarre happenings all around. The Three-Body Problem is translated to English by Ken Liu (who himself is a science fiction author based out of the US), and won the coveted Hugo award in 2015. Even with the lack of experience with the genre, I could sense that the Three-Body Problem does a lot of justice to Science Fiction. The science is at times tough to follow, dealing with a variety of subjects such as astrophysics, theoretical physics, nanotechnology, and maths to name a few. There are some fascinating scientific concepts, and we can feel the excitement when the characters find a scientific solution to a problem. The USP of the book is its setting. For an international audience not too exposed to novels in Chinese settings, this is a fascinating read. After all, as Liu says through the book, \"In China, any idea that dared to take flight will only crash back to the ground. The gravity of reality is too strong.\" It is refreshing to see an apocalyptic story where a country other than USA takes the centre stage. However, I felt that the writing itself was not consistently great. There were parts where I felt emotionally connected, and there were others where the plot was more of a driver than the emotions beneath. I attribute this to the genre itself. It is probably the complexity of the plot that necessitates the lessened focus on character development. As it so often happens in such books, I could connect really well with the happenings of the past, and not so much with the present. Also, most characters in the novel are scientists of some kind, and even if they are not, they are able to quickly grasp arcane scientific concepts. Take the Princeps or Da Shi, who are able to make important decisions based on scientific facts despite not being involved in scientific research. I was amused to that even some of the metaphors used to convey emotions are scientific in nature, such as \"She could no longer feel grief. She was now like a Geiger counter that had been subjected to too much radiation, no longer capable of giving any reaction, noiselessly displaying a reading of Zero.\" Liu Cixin is able to convey emotions very well when they involve individual characters, however when it comes to conveying emotions through dialogue, I personally didn't get the same effect. There is a hint that Liu Cixin has a good diversity in style : I enjoyed the hilarious story of a maths prodigy who is too lazy to act on anything, but still ends up solving an underlying scientific riddle. But this book by itself does not give Liu Cixin much scope to expose the diversity in terms of style. Ken Liu deserves a lot of appreciation too for setting the Chinese context and back-drop well enough without sounding pedagogical. The common theme running throughout the story is the selfishness of humanity. Take lines like \"How many other acts of humankind that had seemed normal or even righteous were, in reality, evil?\" or \"These are the rules of the game of civilization: the first priority is to guarantee the existence of the human race and their comfortable life. Everything else is secondary\". Cixin is harsh on our destruction of environment, and gives the impression of someone who has lost hope on humanity (as do many of his characters). However reading his afterword (which has been specially added to the English translation), we get a better idea on Liu Cixin's fundamental philosophy that probably defines his works. On the whole, The Three-Body Problem, like a good book should, has made me contemplate on a variety of questions. And considering that the first book has been largely a build up for things to come, I can't wait to get my hands on the second book of this trilogy.

Science-fiction? Sure. A thriller with a convoluted plot? Probably. A classic? Surely not. But then, Virginia Woolf's most famous classic, describing a single day's dusk-to-dawn in early 20th century London, can be accurately described with the word mind-boggling. I have a strange and inexplicable habit of pacing the mundane activities of my life to suit the rhythm of the book I am currently reading. As a child, I remember being asked to go to the grocery store while reading a Perry Mason and literally running to the shop until I realized that my life isn't as fast-paced as Gardner's courtroom thrillers and forced myself to slow down. After Dumbledore and Voldemart came face-to-face in Harry Potter and The Order of Phoenix, I couldn't sit down for a long time until my excitement subsided. Reading Mrs.Dalloway, I frequently found myself breathless trying to keep pace with the narrative. There is not much in terms of plot in Mrs.Dalloway. Clarissa Dalloway is hosting a party, while unconnectdly, a soldier fresh out of World War 1 is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The threads intersect as characters wander through the streets of London often coming across one another. The general rule of fiction writing is to take an ordinary character and put them in an extra-ordinary situation. Mrs.Dalloway is an extra-ordinary woman in ordinary circumstances, and this is not the first rule of writing that Virginia Woolf breaks. Mrs.Dalloway is humble though, imagining that \"her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct\". On the said day, she looks back at her life and reflects on what she has become. Her husband is normal in most senses of the word, but \"with twice his wits, she had to see things through his eyes - one of the tragedies of married life\". Her reminiscences take her back to the days of her youth, and her friends Sally and Peter, making her wonder how her life would have turned out if she had married Peter. There are two parallel philosophies in Mrs.Dalloway both of which are existential in nature and recognize the futility of human life. \"One cannot bring children into a world like this. One cannot perpetuate suffering, or increase the breed of these lustful animals, who have no lasting emotions but only whims and vanities, eddying them now this way, now that\", says one strand, while the other strand counters this with \"As we are a doomed race, chained to a sinking ship, as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners; decorate the dungeons with flowers and air-cushions; be as decent as we possible can. Those ruffians, the Gods, shan't have it all their own way\". The striking thing about Mrs. Dalloway is the narrative technique. The famed climatic scene from Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina was my first exposure to the power of a stream-of-conscious narration. Mrs.Dalloway uses this technique throughout. The genius of Virginia Woolf lies in how one scene segues to the next, seamlessly transporting us from the mind from one narrator to the mind of another. Her descriptions are heavy, and her sentences are long, often extending to complete paragraphs. For example, consider these lines which describe the humble experience of a guy falling asleep in a public park : \"A great brush swept smooth across his mind, sweeping across it moving branches, children's voices, the shuffle of feet, and people passing, and humming traffic, raising and falling traffic. Down, down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep, sank, and was muffled over\". There is also a hint of rationality, feminism and a critique on how society views mental illness, all of which were much ahead of the time when the book was published (1925). The narration of Mrs.Dalloway is an immense feat in itself, and to be honest, I felt it very hard to keep up at times. I struggled for the first few pages to dig into the story, and kept struggling each time I went back to the book after a break. But once I succeeded in digging into the narration, I couldn't come out of it. Mrs.Dalloway is a beautiful book. I regret that I didn't read it as carefully as I should have, but I will forever remember the wonderful experience of reading it. And I would probably revisit this book multiple times over the years to get more of the nuances.

Manu Joseph's wit and cynicism are in full display in Serious Men, which is set in Mumbai (\"the humid crowds, the great perpetual squeeze, the silent vengeance of the poor\"). Hidden beneath the clever one-liners is an intertwined tale of two vastly different men in dissimilar circumstances trying to break free from the stereotypes on them. Ayyan Mani is a son of a sweeper, a Dalit - among the lowest of castes in Indian caste hierarchy. He is extremely well versed in the ways of the World, deeply cynical, and is capable of getting things done. His anger is Manu Joseph's anger, his perversions are our perversions. However he is not where he wants to be in his life, and he has a strong sense that this is due to his caste. \"If you only had the fathers that these men had, you would have had a room of your own today with your own secretary\", a character tells him, and one can only agree. Ayyan Mani lives with his wife Oja and 11-year old son Adi in a densely populated tenement for the poor. \"In a way, this was the easiest place to be a man. To be alive was enough. To be sober and employed was fantastically impressive. Ayyan Mani was something of a legend\". Ayyan Mani has one opportunity to use his cruel sense of humour and get back at the World. The risks are immense, especially to his partially deaf son Adi. But Ayyan senses that he may not be able to stop himself before it is too late. Arvind Acharya is the director of Indian Institute of Theory and Research. He is a Tamil Brahmin, and has a \"newsworthy rage and tragic brilliance\". Tall, good looking, arrogant, incisive, but past his prime. His reputation is spotless, and his words carry respect through-out the scientific community everywhere. Acharya is not a man bothered with the practicalities of the World, and he is in pursuit of higher truths (whereas Ayyan believes that there is \"no such thing as truth.\" There is \"only pursuit of truth and it was a pursuit that would always go on. It was a form of employment\"). He loves his wife Lavanya in the per-functionary way a couple whose marriage has been arranged love each other. He laments that scientists are more focused at research in \"time reversal, black holes, dark matter, dark energy, invisibility, intelligent civilisations\", or what he terms as \"Exciting rubbish\". He has his own eccentric theories on life. However he faces an institutional opposition, and a threat to his own sense of morality. Having read Manu Joseph's The Illicit Happiness of Other People earlier (review here), I felt that there are some commonalities in his work. A bit of science in the plot, and a memory that cannot be explained away by Science; a random set of facts that are memorized and repeated; a disregard for male friendships (\"That men, in reality, did not have friends in other men\" in Serious Men and \"that any two men in the world have real affection between them is itself a myth, chiefly of the two men\" in the Illicit Happiness of Other People) and much more. Needless to say, I enjoyed both his works thoroughly. Serious Men is largely funny, and is littered with unexpectedly poignant moments. Manu Joseph is the ultimate troll, and he is endurable because his wrath is not directed towards a single idealogy or group of people. Dalits, Brahmins, Christians, Tamils (\"Most Tamilians so tiny and genetically predisposed to believing something is wrong with others\"), the rich (\"Rich people have a name for everything. They even have word for the time a man spends with his family.. they call it 'Quality Time'\"), the poor, the random motorist (\"After riding like a moron all over the place, observe the face of an Indian when he crashes. He is stunned.\"), the educated and the irresponsible - no one is safe from Manu Joseph's vitriol. In my review of The Illicit Happiness of Other People, I had compared him with Oscar Wilde and written that \"he throws up aphorisms which sound attractive but are not necessarily true\". The same pattern is evident in Serious Men too, which is littered with witty one-liners such as \"The fate of every love story, he knew very well, is in the rot of togetherness, or in the misery of separation\" which are not falsifiable. The only discernible downside is that the conclusion of Serious Men seems a bit forced, with some filmy moments. This is exactly what I felt about the conclusion of \"The Illicit Happiness.. \" too. But once again, I see that there are not many logical ways the plot could have ended. The supporting characters are all caricatures, and this contributes immensely to the humour. I enjoyed the simple-mindedness of Oja, who keeps throwing folk sayings such as \"the end of an ox is beef, the end of a lie is grief\". Serious Men is a worthy read, especially for privileged Indians (such as me) who wish to know how easy things have been for them. I remain a fan of Manu Joseph, both his fictional works and his weekly columns.

Scott Fitzgerald\nMy rating: 3 of 5 stars\n\"It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being\" I picked Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise from my local public library for two reasons : I wanted to read a classic; and having moved to an area not far away from Princeton, I was attracted by the blurb that indicated that a major part of the story takes place in Princeton. It occurred to me a bit later that the place would have changed immensely in the last century and that I might not be able to relate to the geography after all. With Scott Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical debut novel set in early 20th century, not only was I not able to relate to the place, I was not able to relate to the characters too for the most part of the book. This Side of Paradise is the coming-of-age story of Amory Blaine. Amory's father is dismissed off quickly as \"an ineffectual, inarticulate man\". We learn that Amory takes after his mother (\"But Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman!\"). Beatrice comes from an European family of wealth, and ensures that for a good part of Amory's life, he does not have to worry about petty things such as money. She treats her son in a way we could only envy, with advice such as \"dear, don't think of getting out of bed yet. I've always suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous\". Amory's initial education consists of private tutoring, until he decides to attend prep school at America. These were different times, and Amory attends a boarding school with the grand motto \"To impart a Thorough Mental, Moral, and Physical Training\u0026nbsp; as a Christian Gentleman, to fit the boy for meeting problems of his day and generation, and to give a solid foundation in the Arts and Sciences\". His teachers think of him as \"idle, unreliable and superficially clever\", but he does not get the message. Amory completes school thinking highly of himself, and with disenchantment from his first love. At Princeton University, Amory is in single minded pursuit of his ambition to maintain a high status, as are most of his fellow students. He discovers literature with his friends, and attempts a lot of not-so-ambitious poetry. He is terribly self-concerned (as Fitzgerald points out, he is just a \"romantic egotist\"). If you are a fan of such things, there are some beautiful lines here that describe the passage of various seasons, and there are many references to other literary works of the time. I am not, so I had through hurry through this phase with as much disinterest as Amory had on his studies. There are some exhilarating sequences, such as the one where a set of students elope for an unplanned vacation and eat a lot of expensive food without paying much. Amory, in the mean time, falls in love, and falls out of it once again. He also comes across Monsignor Darcy, an old friend of Beatrice and a mentor figure to Amory. Darcy is \"intensely ritualistic, startlingly dramatic, loved the idea of God enough to be celibate, and rather liked his neighbor\". Monsignor Darcy gives some important advice to Amory, such as \"we're not personalities, but personages\". However Amory does not seem to be taking much note. World War 1 intervenes, but we do read much about it. Amory's outlook towards the war is described as \"the attitude he might have held toward an amusing melodrama, he hoped it would be long and bloody. If it had not continued he would have felt like an irate ticket holder at a prizefight where the principals refused to mix up\". The whole World War passes away as an interlude of a few pages. Amory is a changed man after the war, or so we think. But he falls in love once again with a girl artfully described as \"her philosophy is carpe diem for herself and laissez faire for others\". It takes a few more episodes, and a few more flings with various women before Amory realizes that he has run out of the considerable sum of money he had inherited. Amory turns a new leaf, and even starts to develop an affection to communism (\"However the brain and abilities of men may differ, their stomachs are essentially the same\").\u0026nbsp; This Side of Paradise has an unpredictable narrative, taking the form of prose, poetry, and even drama. This in itself is extremely innovative. The writing is brilliant at times, and let's just say that I couldn't recognize the brilliance at other times. What kept me going was the fact that Scott Fitzgerald does not pretend that his protagonist is a hero. The writing is self-aware, and is self-critical of Amory's narrow-mindedness. This was after all a generation at the beginning of a new century, a generation that was caught in a war unlike anything else preceding it. The importance of this book, is thus, more contextual than objective. This Side of Paradise makes more sense for students of literature than to the lay reader.

They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them\" There are two possible reactions to Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time : people either love it, or people hate the fact that other people love it. Mark Haddon's debut novel has been compared by many to Catcher in the Rye, and both books are similar in at least this respect. Additionally, both Catcher in the Rye and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time do not dwell on emotions. But I believe the comparison ends there, for the latter has a genuine reason for being emotionally indifferent. The story is narrated in first person by Christopher, who has an unusual thought process. There is clearly a psychological condition he suffers from, and apparently the psychological condition was named in the cover of the initial versions of the book, but the later versions do not specify it. The crux is that Christopher lacks emotional intelligence (\"I find people confusing\"), but makes up for it with his photographic memory (\"I see everything\") and his mathematical and analytical abilities. Christopher hates most people \u0026nbsp;(“All the other children at my school are stupid. Except I'm not meant to call them stupid, even though this is what they are”), but he loves dogs (“I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking. It has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk”). He hates novels, but loves detective fiction of the Sherlock Holmes kind. He hates metaphors (\"metaphors are lies\"), but is willing to suffer similes and even use a few of them. Christopher equates his own mind to a computer. And like a computer, he behaves unpredictably when he finds himself facing the unfamiliar or the disorderly. When he finds that his neighbor's dog is dead and that the accusation of the murder falls on him, Christopher takes it upon himself to do some \"detecting\" and find the murderer. In what follows, we learn about the emotional turbulence of people around him, and we develop a special attachment to Christopher. The narrative technique is unusual, and things are not described as how a normal person sees them. For instance, instead of describing people's faces, Christopher describes the kind of shoes and socks they are wearing (for he does not look them in the eye). At times, he just doodles out what he wishes to describe with a \"it looked like this\". There are numerous digressions with puzzles, mathematical calculations, maps, and listicles. Some readers would find the meandering narrative to be novel and attractive, whereas others would dismiss it as a distracting gimmick. The general accusations against Mark Haddon are two-fold : that the plot does not have much apart from the gimmicky writing and that he portrays a mental condition inaccurately. I did not feel either of these to be a major turn-off. The narrative technique held me till the end, and I am not going to take a fictional depiction as a model to judge people with special abilities. Personally, I was more interested in the character arc of Christopher's flawed parents. Probably Haddon's larger point is that the people considered to be normal by societal standards are not in complete emotional control too. Of course, I felt it strange that except for the parents and an intriguing teacher we never get to meet in present tense, all other characters were glossed over, some of them becoming just caricatures. However in my personal opinion the book is engaging and short enough to read quickly, and one can ignore such minor flaws. That puts me among the first group of people who love The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. And I love this simplified explanation of love from the book : \"loving someone is helping them when they get into trouble, and looking after them, and telling them the truth\" View all my reviews and ratings from Goodreads ","date":"27 April 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-mark-haddons-the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time","type":"posts"},{"content":" Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond\nMy rating: 4 of 5 stars\nIn 1532, 168 Spanish men faced nearly 80000 men of the Inca empire at Peru. What was supposed to be a parlay between the Incas and the visiting Spanish men was actually a subterfuge by Spanish Conquistador Francisso Pizzaro, and in the ensuing battle, around 5 Spanish men lost their lives. They won the battle though, having killed approximately 7000 Inca army men. How was this possible? Jared Diamond's answer is \"Guns, Germs and Steel\". In his Pulitzer winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel : The fates of humans societies\", Jared Diamond attempts to answer a question by a New Guinean politician Yali on why there is a fundamental wealth inequality in the World. At first glance, the inequality seems to arise from an intellectual and cultural difference - after all, most major modern inventions were centred at Europe, the cradle of Industrial revolution. Jared Diamond wants to explore deeper though and arrive at the \"ultimate causes\" rather than the \"proximate causes\". To do this, he attempts to re-look at human societies since the Ice Age around 13000 years ago (approx. 11000 B.C) to get to the bottom of Yali's question. In fact, he actually starts 7 million years ago ever since human beings are understood to have walked the earth in Africa (though the history until 11000 BC is compressed into a single chapter of nearly 20 pages). To summarize the history of the whole of humanity, that too in just a little more than 400 pages, is no mean feat. It becomes harder considering the amount of subjects Jared Diamond attempts to deal with - archaeology, epidemiology, biology, geography, linguistics, botany, and much more. The author largely pulls it off though. He does this because he identifies broad patterns throughout human history. The broad pattern is simple - humans were initially hunters and gatherers, but some regions were blessed with edible, nutritious wild plants and domesticable animals. Some plants are easier to cultivate than others, some animals are easier to domesticate than others (or as Diamond puts is, The Anna Karenina principle). These regions favoured food production, leading to a sedentary society with large population density and a centralized decision-body, which in turn led to people with specialized skills and occupation. As a side-effect, the societies also developed immunity to various diseases by being in close contact with animals. These were hence the societies that had the time and labour to invent things. Also, geographic factors such as connectivity, climate, topology, the orientation of the landmass, and presence of similar societies around hastened the whole progression. He concludes that Eurasia was blessed in this regard, and hence European countries came out on top. The inequality, Jarod Diamond repeatedly stresses throughout the book, has nothing to do with the inherent superiority or inferiority of one race over another. The range of subjects Diamond deals with is insane. As a lay reader with almost zero knowledge on most of the subjects being dealt with, I found this book to be highly informative and educative. That is not to say that the book was not entertaining - Guns, Germs and Steel is written in an accessible and engaging style, encouraging lay audience to read it. I was mildly dissapointed about a few things that are not personally convincing to me, despite the fact that Jared Diamond touches upon these concerns towards the end of the book (and in an afterword written 6 years after the book's publication). The most happening place in the World in Jared Diamond's epic work is the Fertile Crescent, which is, I understand, roughly in the middle east surrounded by countries like Iran, Iraq, Syria. This is still the most happening place today, but for all the wrong reasons. Diamond seems to attribute this to the the geographical features being reversed, probably due to excessive deforestation; which seems to me to be a very simplistic explanation. A similar personal disappointment was with the fact that not much of the book deals with India, which finds only passing mention throughout the book. The epilogue and the afterword attributes India's current state to \"caste system\" and too much \"fragmentation\" between various regions within the country (prior to independence) and leaves it at that. In general, Diamond seems to concentrate on historical events that fit his pattern and quickly gloss over those which might not fit in easily. Also I felt that the humorous tone Diamond puts on at times did not work out. This was particularly true for me while Diamond describes why certain animals were not domesticated, making the chapter morose. I looked at a few other reviews of the book, and the negative ones point out that the book endorses \"Geographical determinism\" and does not give importance to individual brilliance or cultural characteristics that may have determined many critical moments in history. I do not find this to be an issue with the book though. In fact, science already looks at humanity impersonally as a biological accident. I don't find it far fetched to think that geography has as much influence on us as, say, genetics (Jared Diamond thinks it has much much more influence than genetics). The caveat with such a thinking is that it supports determinism, and removes moral responsibility. When Jared Diamond implies that if Indian Americans from Mesoamerica and Europeans from Europe had geographically exchanged places in some sort of mass Freaky Friday scenario, the Indian Americans would have invented the motor car. And further more, they would have gone on to brutally kill millions of Europeans. He basically absolves Europeans of their ingeniousness as well as inhumanity. This is a tricky slope, and one needs to be careful of what the conclusions are. The impunity with which Europeans exterminated societies throughout the World is worthy of our disgust, and nothing should make us forget that. Despite the minor disappointments, I am very grateful I picked this book and persisted till the end. I now know a lot more about human societies than I did. For example, I know now that the people in New Zeland and Hawai actually originated in China, probably Taiwan. I also know that the same people developed into a race that conquered Madagascar, which is all extremely fascinating. Most importantly, my interest to learn more history has been kindled. Do give this book a try, and you are unlikely to regret it.

Naipaul\nMy rating: 3 of 5 stars\nV.S.Naipaul's A Bend in the River begins with Salim, a muslim in Africa with Indian ancestry, moving from the eastern coast of Africa to an unnamed town situated at the bend of an unidentified river in Central Africa. There has been a revolution we learn; Europeans have taken control of large parts of Africa from the Arabs, and Africans from the \"bush\" -- natives who feel they have had enough -- unleash violent reactions on Europians and all other kinds of foreigners. Considering that I know very little about African history, and lesser about most of the demographics in question, I had to read through many interpretations of the book to confirm my understanding of my book. I agree with some of the interpretations, and disagree with a few others, but like the book itself, all of them are worthy of considerable thought. I know very little about African history because I gain most of my knowledge from the backdrops of fictional works (\"Non-fiction can distort; facts can be realigned. But fiction never lies.\"), and I have not read any books set in Africa. I did try once, and picked up a novel by a famed author. For a long time, the book described the narrator getting high on some African drink, and the language was so confusing that I gave up without finding out if the author was too clever for me or if I was too clever to read this author. There are no such problems with A Bend in the River - the language is simple enough, but V.S.Naipaul is much cleverer than me. The prose flows like a river as we follow a part of Salim's life. He settles down on the said unnamed town and witnesses drastic changes to the anonymous country that affects his life. The country is Congo, say many readers who know about such things. It doesn't matter though, for V.S.Naipaul is driving at the larger picture. Looking at it one way, he seems to say that individuals do not have control over their lives when put in such volatile backdrops. Like Shakespeare remarked, \"As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods. They kill us for their sport\". Looking at it from another angle, things become more problematic; for he seems to suggest that Africa was better off under colonial rule. In other words, some people, such as Africans, are incapable of ruling themselves. As Salim sets down to live life in his own modest ways, he meets a handful of personalities all of whom are struggling like him for their own identity and place in the World. Revolutions come and go, and slowly, an authoritarian dictator referred to as \"Big Man\" strengthens his hold on his country. The foreigners, the natives, the elites, the uneducated are all pawns in the Big Man's plans, to be elevated and discarded at whim. The Big Man uses patriotism as a glue to try and extend his control. We get a glimpse into the Big Man through an array of characters, prominent among whom is an European historian who is more of an academic. In my opinion, Indar has the best character graph. A couple of monologues from Indar are still relevant to migrants across the World - people stuck between the past, the present and the future; people stuck between here, there and nowhere. While Naipaul's writing has won him a nobel prize and appreciation from across western press, there are some glitches if you look hard in a certain way. Salim is a problematic narrator. There is a curious passage where he unleashes violence on a woman and and she shrugs it off. Also there seems to be a definite lean towards western civilization, and scorn towards Arabs. An offhand remarks suggests that some slaves like to be slaves, and are better off as slaves. The problem with the book is not these biases alone, for each of us have our own biases. It is rather that Salim seems to think he is much better off than the people of the bush, when there is not much evidence to back this up. We do not see much of Salim's modus operandi. He buys things, he sells it to others. In contrast, certain characters like Nazerudeen have discernible business acumen. Salim seems to think that though fate has its own vagaries, he deserves more than the many unnamed and unrepresented people of the bush. To this, I do not agree. I was surprised that V.S.Naipaul's own views from many of his interviews coincide with Salim's, making the book more autobiographical. Hence, Salim is an endorsement of the author's views, and his actions can not be overlooked as the quips of a fictional character. On the whole, A Bend in the River is a good starting point for me to explore more on African history, which seems to have a lot to think about. As a novel, it does not have a conventional plot, but V.S.Naipaul is in absolute control of his prose. And the book is short enough. I would definitely suggest A Bend in the River. Chances are that you would love it more than I did.

For what has he been arrested? We don't know. By whom? We don't know. What next? We don't know. On the surface, this could become a thriller on the lines of any Robert Ludlum novel. But Kafka is not an on-the-surface writer. His strength is to take a totally unlikely situation, and still have the characters react as if nothing is out of ordinary. Just like in Kafka's other famous novel, the Metamorphosis, which starts with the lines \"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin.\" Once Josef K. is arrested, he is informed that he can carry on with his life, keep working at his bank, and the only difference from normal life would, at least initially, be that he would be summoned for weekly hearings. K is the sort of person who is successful by normal societal standards - he is respected, has a job where he is his high up in the organization, and is regarded as intellectually capable. However none of these help K. as he tries to navigate the bureaucracy of this puzzling court that has arrested him. He meets a lot of strange characters, talks to a lot of people, but the bleakness of his situation remains. It is like solving a frustrating puzzle where you are destined to lose. Destined is an important word here, for Kafka seems to be making a layered commentary on destiny and the helplessness of an individual while facing life. To be honest, I found the going a bit difficult at times with The Trial. What kept me at it was Kafka's brilliant sense of humour, all of which is derived from his surrealism. This is not a book for everybody. You can't be sure of what is happening, you can't relate to how the characters react, there is not much of a conclusion, and there is no happiness. If you can look past all of these, you might recognize the brilliance of The Trial.

You never saw him as a man with a man’s heart, and a man’s failings—I’ll grant you it may have been hard to see, he makes so few mistakes, but he makes ’em like all of us.\"\n\"Madam, my father has left me flopping like a flounder at low tide and you say what's the matter.\" There is a lesson for me from Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchmen. Do not trust reviews. Books, movies, places, people and most things else are subjective, and you miss out when you dismiss things based on someone else's opinion. I almost did. Go Set A Watchman is Harper Lee's second novel, published fifty five years after her legendary, much-beloved debut novel To Kill A Mockingbird which gave us Atticus Finch. Apart from being one of the best ever literary characters ever, Atticus Finch has also had the honour of being my email password at one point of time. No wonder thus that I lapped up news on Go Set A Watchman ever since it was announced, and frantically waited for the first reviews to come out. \"Atticus Finch is a racist bigot\", declared the reviews and drained away all my interest. I wouldn't have read the book at all, but the book found me. \"Every man’s island, Jean Louise, every man’s watchman, is his conscience. There is no such thing as a collective conscious\", says Doctor Finch, Atticus's eccentric but brilliant younger brother. There is no such thing as collective opinion too. \"You're very much like him, except you're a bigot and he's not… Not a big one, just an ordinary turnip-sized bigot\", he accuses twenty six year old Jean Louise Finch, or Scout as we knew her when she was six years old. It is a controversial and debatable accusation, for Scout is the only character in this book who is almost not-bigoted. When Scout is as shocked as us -- the readers -- at this accusation, he goes on to justify his statement: \"what does a bigot do when he meets someone who challenges his opinions? He doesn’t give. He stays rigid. Doesn’t even try to listen, just lashes out.\" There is a strange sense of irony to Go Set a Watchman. Scout is now an independent woman making a career in New York. She makes occasional visits South to Maycomb, where her home is. On this particular visit home however, she starts noticing things she hadn't before. While being wooed by Henry \"Hank\" Clinton, Scout realizes that she does not fit into her place of birth. She likes Hank, but does she love him? She also goes on to discover that her own father is against equal rights for \"Niggers\", feels strongly against a Supreme Court judgment that terms segregation of whites and blacks in schools as illegal, and feels that a citizen should “earn the right to vote”. I am a \"Jeffersonian Democrat\", he declares, defending his stance. We are Scout, and we feel her confusion. \"Why doesn’t their flesh creep? How can they devoutly believe everything they hear in church and then say the things they do and listen to the things they hear without throwing up? I thought I was a Christian but I’m not. I’m something else and I don’t know what\", she asks her uncle. Go Set A Watchmen's plot is this confusion. Harper Lee's writing is as attractive as it was in To Kill a Mockingbird (of course, this book was supposed to have been written before To Kill a Mockingbird). There are flashbacks taking us to Scout's school days, and these parts are hilarious and delightful. The dynamics of a family that does not have a feminine figure to guide a daughter is portrayed so well. Two major characters from \".. Mockingbird\", Jem and Dill, are absent in \"..Watchman\". Jem is apparently dead of a heart-attack, and Dill is somewhere in Europe. Atticus Finch is still a great parent. He bails out his kids so many times out of trouble. “Integrity, humor, and patience were the three words for Atticus Finch.” Even his fall from grace is not abrupt, and it is consistent with his World view. The grown up Scout is still as tomboyish, but has her moments of self-doubt. After all, convention dictates how a women should be, and every women who fights convention has to fight self-doubt too. Go Set a Watchman is essentially a coming of age novel, where a girl (a woman) learns that her father has flaws and learns to accept it. Opinions vary on whether this book was really required. After all, the book is a \"first draft\" which was allegedly set aside, and there was a lot of money to be made in publishing it with or without the author's explicit consent. Opinions also vary on the act of corrupting one of the greatest male characters of all time. In my personal opinion, this is a much needed book. Most of us are content to classify things in binary - we elevated Atticus to God, and we are ready to bring him down as a racist. Go Set A Watchman is at its core against such delineation. To put it crudely, you might say that it asks us to \"reason with racists\". However, it could also be put differently, as Dr.Finch does when he remarks \"the time your friends need you is when they’re wrong, Jean Louise. They don’t need you when they’re right” I wouldn't go as far as to recommend this book as a great read; it might disappoint many of you, as it has disappointed cleverer and more practiced readers than me. However I believe that this is not a book to be dismissed. The views of some of the characters in the book may seem regressive, but remember that this was written years back, and as society grows, our idea of what is regressive changes. We will never know Harper Lee's own views on a lot of these topics, but the characters reflect the mindsets of a lot of decent people. From what I make of it, her views can probably be summed up using the words of advice Atticus gives to a suitor of his own daughter on how to woo her: “Don’t push her. Let her go at her own speed. Push her and every mule in the county’d be easier to live with.” To me, Go Set a Watchman was a delightful read that took me to a faraway place, and had characters I could relate to. Give it a try, and you might feel the same too.

I am twenty-seven years old, and I haven't learnt to comb my hair. To those who have seen me for any length of time, this would not be an earth-shattering revelation. However if you were, by any chance, attributing my hairstyle to the fact that I am too cool to care (which I am not), here you have it from the horse's mouth. I do not know how to comb my hair. Worse, I can not differentiate a good hair-style from a bad one.\u0026nbsp; Once every month, I get my hair cut so short that combing isn't necessary. It then grows damn fast as I struggle to tame it. After a point I give up, and get it cut again. I am just back from my monthly haircut, this time from one of the posh, professional, air-conditioned parlours which have a receptionist, pay their taxes and force us to do the same, and have English magazines to entertain us - magazines filled with photos of unsmiling male and female models. \"Is this what handsome is like?\", I ask myself looking at the pictures. \"Is THAT a good hairstyle?\". \u0026nbsp;I can't help but get reminded that things are changing too fast. It was different when I was a kid. As a schoolboy, getting a haircut was a Saturday chore. With three males in the house, my dad would strictly tell us that the three of us should not get our hairs cut on the same day. That would indicate an inauspicious occasion. We would do a cursory visual examination to decide whose haircut can't wait, and split up the Saturdays accordingly. Barber shops were a sort of cultural centers, akin to the cafes and bars of 19th century where great thinkers discussed revolutionary ideas and creativity was born. I would head to the nearest barber, tell him one word -- \"short\" -- and slip into my own World. The conversations from around me would occasionally penetrate my reverie. \"Karunanidhi is a scheming old man\", \"Jayalalitha is a cruel dictator\", \"When MGR was alive..\". There would be a TV or radio playing melodious songs, and I would drift into a quick and relaxing nap, until the barber wakes me up with an \"enough?\" After a clueless inspection of the mirror, I would nod approvingly, handover a hundred rupee note, collect the change, and walk home taking care not to meet anyone's eye. Haircuts were a personal thing to me, and I was not too eager to advertise mine to the World. Once, my mom embarrassed me by barging into an all-male barber shop and threatening the barber to make my hair stylish and modern. \"That mushroom thingy, or whatever. Do that. Anything but the bloody short-crop-crap\". The barber advised me to come back after the growing the hair some more, and I found another barber to cut my hair short. Another time, a barber asked me if he can use a machine. I gave vague consent without having any idea what he was talking about. When he was done, he had given me the worst haircut ever in a life filled with bad haircuts. My hair-style, or the lack of it, did not go unnoticed at school. \"It looks like you have a helmet on your head\", remarked a classmate, who started calling me \"helmet\". \"helmet-ey!\", he would shout from across the yard, making girls snigger at me in chorus. I assure you, I do not have any dark powers. But one day, during our PT period, this guy ran straight into a field where a shot-put tournament was being held, and a shot-put ball thrown by a powerful girl landed straight on his head. Eyewitnesses assured us that his head had split open. He was rushed to a hospital, his parents were summoned. Students were whispering that the boy wouldn't survive. As I was rushing towards my class a couple of weeks later, I heard someone yell \"helmet-ey!\" I turned up to look at a fully plastered face, and retorted with a \"shotput-ey!\" Rude. Cruel. But effective. However, as I grew up, India grew with me. Middle class households started becoming rich. Corporates started paying people more. Autos were replaced with occasional taxis. Shopping became a thing. The new India was confident, and had an opinion on everything. They knew what they wanted, and how they wanted it done. The new India knew choice, and exercised it at every opportunity. The impact on barbershops was that barbers suddenly started asking too many questions. Somewhere around this time, I realized that my eyes were myopic (there are anecdotes about this too, reserved for another day), and started wearing a spectacles. The first thing I would do before sitting on the barber's chair was to remove the spectacles and place it on a slab. \"Short, or medium?\", the barber would ask. \"short, but not too short\". \"How short?\" \"Short, but not too short\". \"Straight or round\". \"Dude! You decide on what you think looks good.\". At this point, I would realize that there are two kinds of barbers in this World. The first would sigh, do nothing to hide the fact that they considered me to be an useless idiot, and cut my hair with visible disinterest. The worst of this kind would ask me more questions, and secretly laugh as I made a mess of my own hairstyle with my ignorant answers . The other kind, however, suddenly reveal themselves as creatures of brotherly affection. They invest themselves in making my hair look good, and proudly beam at me once their work is done. These kind of barbers are my soulmates. I have often given serious thought to marrying one of them, and carrying them around with me for my monthly haircuts.\u0026nbsp; A few years back, I wanted to write about a very small Tamil movie made by a debutante director. Two things struck me about the movie - the liveliness of the colours that were on display, and the fact that the saddest scene in this movie about a roadside romeo who is spurred by about half-a-dozen girls is when he comes out of a barbershop with a bad haircut. The hero is devastated, cries and wails, and covers his head with a cap on his next day to college to hide his hairstyle. There is not much point in writing about Attakathi now, as director Pa.Ranjith is now into the big league and too many people have written about his movies. However, I feel that barbers and the act of getting a haircut have not got enough coverage in literature and movies. Of course, Harry Potter has a famously unruly hair. Many a days I have petted my own hair affectionately as I waited for a letter of admission from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was a rude shock to learn that I will have to suffer my hair in the real World, and not a magical one.\u0026nbsp; A few gray hairs are starting to grow on my head these days, and my hair falls at such a rate that I wonder if the rate of fall would exceed the rate of growth soon. Not much has changed in my own expectations out of a haircut though. However, what we have today is a chain of corporate barber shops, or \"unisex salons\". Expensive, and not worth the money for the short-crop I need. The smaller shops owned by individuals are still around, but they are fighting desperately to hold on and the result is increased price everywhere. My haircut last month was done by one such small time barber, and I had to get it done prematurely. This is a shop my brother frequents, probably as the only customer. After getting a haircut, my brother offered a hundred rupee note to the barber, only to be told that the barbed did not have change. In fact, this barber did not have any money at all. My brother told me that the barber had offered to do another haircut for someone in the family, and so off I went the next day. The barber was sprawled on the floor, taking a nap, and woke up hurriedly to greet his first, and by all signs the only, customer of the day. The water supply lines had been cut off, and there was no power. The bills were not paid. There were people outside shouting at him to return the money he had borrowed. The only good out of all this is that the barber asked me zero questions on how I wanted my hair cut.\u0026nbsp; The most irritating thing about the salons, on the other hand, is the confident and assertive guy sitting at the next chair. I saw such a guy today. \"This part should be short\", he indicated with his hands. \"It should be thin here, and thick here\". \"And this\", he concluded, \"must go like this\", waving his hands around. Throughout the haircut, this guy was offering backseat instructions to the barber. Every time such a thing happens, I am reminded of the legendary actor Vadivel ordering a Uthappam at a hotel. You must definitely watch the scene if you haven't. Even if you don't understand Tamil. Meanwhile, I tried indicating to my own barber that I fare very badly at any sort of questions, but the hints were ignored. \"Is this enough\", he asked me after a while. I peered at the mirror with my myopic eyes, realized that I couldn't see clearly without my glasses which were safely afar on a slab, pretended to critically inspect his handiwork, and finally nodded as if I was satisfied. Few hours later, I am still not sure if my hair looks passably good now. The thing I hate most about the modern World is the amount of choice at our hands. In IT parlance, I expect a barber to be a domain expert, knowing what hairstyle would me suit me best. And what would suit me best is something that is neither too shabby not too attractive. Basically, something that is not noticeable at all. What would suit me is less choice on things I don't care much about.

It was no surprise thus that he chose to reflect on his life of twenty-eighth years at the exact moment when a resolute punch was half-a-second shy of landing on his face. He was, more specifically, attempting to identify the turning point of his life, the moment that shifted events to come irreversibly leading to him standing here at the Medavakkam Koot Road traffic signal, bracing for a blow. Was it the day when as a ten-year old, his own meekness denied him his favorite thayir-vadais on a train journey to Madurai with family friends? Or was it the day when he checked-in his location at the J.F.K airport to get 153 likes from his Facebook friends? Was it the day when he decided to quit his job and come back to India for good? Or, was it the day when he concluded that all corporates are equally pathetic, and that he should rejoin IT? Was it much before, even before he was born, when his father had picked up a chit each from two lots of folded papers with the words \"Z.Narayanan\" and \"Z.Malavika\"? It was each of them and all of them. Every moment, every decision and every action in a person's life conspire together to make them what they are today. What was Narayanan today? He was a scrawny guy often mistaken for someone younger. But he had momentarily forgotten his physique on his morning bike ride to his office. When a black Swift Dezire had trotted along the middle of the road, he had zipped past it from the left lane gesturing viciously at the bespectacled driver whose left hand was holding up a mobile phone. Another Project Manager on his way to work. A Yamaha R200 insistently buzzing its horn from behind had evicted from Narayanan the loud curse \"what's the hurry, you moron!\" And when a Toyota Qualis had harried him with loud horn when the signal was red at Medavakkam junction, Narayanan decided not to budge. He glanced at the rear view mirror to see a driver draped in silk-white shirt frantically yelling at him. He turned his head a full 180 degree, and lip-synced a generic curse word. He would wonder later on if the driver had interpreted his lip moments wrongly, exaggerating the humble cuss word he had uttered. However, his thoughts were presently occupied replaying his life as the driver walked to him, adjusting his silk-white veshti. Scowling, the driver\u0026nbsp;pulled his left hand back. The wrist which landed on Narayanan was as thick as hardened cement. Things were a blur after that, until he woke up a couple of minutes later. He was on the ground. His knees hurt with the pressure of his Bajaj Pulsar on them, and a wetness was slowly beginning to form beneath his left thigh, reddening his jean. \"Bloody Indians\", he thought, \"random hooligans don't punch your face like this in America\".

Martin\nMy rating: 3 of 5 stars\n*Minor Spoilers ahead*\n\"A Feast For Crows\" is a misleading title, as there is not much fodder for the crows here. The war of five kings is at its fag end, and there is an uneasy calm to the South of Westeros as it concentrates on rebuilding the ravaged settlements. Except for the ironmen, scattered bloody mummers and Beric Dondarion's troop of outlaws, there are not many swords out. \"An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us, an age for gods and heros\", we are told earlier, and as we expectantly turn through nearly 800 pages of this novel, we realize that \"in the game of thrones, even the humblest of pieces have wills of their own. Sometimes they refuse to make the moves you've planned for them\". George R.R. Martin is a man of detail, and it is his attention to detail that sets him apart from other writers. It also lets him down at times. The Song of Ice and Fire is like a role player computer game, and some characters run out of things to do and end up in loops, repeating the same motions. We have seen it earlier with Bran and Sansa, and we see it now with Briene and Arya. At the end of the book, Martin writes a short, almost apologetic write-up explaining the absence of some of the most interesting characters. What we have as a result is a lot of episodic sub-plots, and POVs from a myriad, not-so-important characters, most of which do not move the larger story forward. We get to know Cersei as she becomes a megalomaniac, and we get to know Jamie, who becomes an unlikely hero. We also learn about a host of other random characters, and a numerous trivia. Why did Illyn Payne lose his tongue? What was Cersei's childhood like? Does Aemon have normal, humane feelings? What are the different harbours in Bravos? How many chains-links to a Maester?\nMany of these sub-plots and tidbits are engrossing. Briene's quest through Cracklaw Point, for instance, takes us through a visually marvelous exploration. However when you already know that the object of her trip is not where she is looking for, the pay-off is underwhelming. Another such instance deals with a \"Queenmaker\", which is an engaging episode but ends up as a dud. Even when things happen, like at Kings Landing, it almost seems farcical with a touch of dark-humour (albeit without the requisite darkness). Which brings us to the thing about A Feast of Crows - without having read the subsequent books in the series, I would not belittle this part at this point of time. For all I know, it could be setting up things for a riveting climax. A calm before the storm. Or maybe, a calm before more calm. But then, how many pages more should I read before I get to find it out? Which brings us to the second thing about A Feast for Crows - did it have to be so damn long?\nView all my reviews\n","date":"15 February 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-a-feast-for-crows---book--4-in-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-series/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of A Feast for Crows - Book # 4 in A Song of Ice and Fire series","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Black Tower by P.D. James\nMy rating: 4 of 5 stars\n\"In this job it wasn't the last piece of jigsaw, the easiest of all, that was important. No, it was the neglected, uninteresting small segment which, slotted into place, suddenly made sense of so many other discarded pieces\"\n'The New Queen of Crime', proclaims the front cover of \"The Black Tower\" by P.D.James. Having never heard of either the author or the book before, I set my expectations on an Agatha Christie like murder mystery. In what is probably a nod to the detective genre, we even have a character called Moriarty. The hero here, Adam Dalgliesh - commander of Scotland Yard, is recuperating from an misdiagnosed illness (probably something to do with an earlier novel in the series). A letter from a childhood companion, the fatherly figure of a priest, requesting his professional advice takes him to Toynton Village in coastal England. Father Baddeley is the \"Chaplain to Toynton Grange, a private home for the young disabled\". Dalgelish takes this as an opportunity to convalesce (a word used often in the book) and brood over his decision to quit detective work. However he reaches to find that his 90 year old friend is dead, buried and cremated. The cause is said to be natural, but Daeglish's is not so sure.\nVery soon into the book, if you make past the tough first few pages, you realize that P.D.James is no Agatha Christie. This is no procedural crime investigation. We have a protagonist just back from a near death experience, with his own mid-life crisis. And the atmosphere is dark. P.D.James is a solid writer, capturing the darkness so well that this could be a Scandinavian thriller. The characters only add to the goriness. There is no white or black, and every character is grey. A man who was cured of a disease by a divine miracle, but who does charity for self-gratification. An ex-convict, a nurse with a history of violence, a promiscuous woman struggling to get out of the place, an illegitimate couple, an unpredictable rich art-collector and a kleptomaniac. The disabled, helpless characters have their own perversions too, and their emotions are more of spite, hate and envy than love. There are mystery poison letters floating around, and deaths that look natural. There is no evidence of foul-play though, and our protagonist does not want to get too invested. After all, Toynton Grange seems like a place where not much would be out of ordinary. As \"The Black Tower\" trots to an unpredictable climax, I felt satisfied at having read the work of a wonderful writer. Others may not feel so, for this book lacks most elements expected of a detective novel. But who are we to fit books into genres and determine how it is to be structured? I would recommend this book for the sheer darkness of the atmosphere, with dialogues such as \"We all suffer from a progressive incurable disease. We call it life\". Go for it, unless you don't like getting a bit scared and depressed.\nView all my reviews\n","date":"3 February 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/review-of-the-black-tower-by-p.d.james/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review of The Black Tower by P.D.James","type":"posts"},{"content":" Drummer In The Dark by Francis Clifford\nMy rating: 3 of 5 stars\nFrancis Clifford's \"Drummer in the dark\" starts with the epigraph \"Do not men die fast enough, without being destroyed by each other?\". A set of explosions rock the United Kingdom, and Duncan Howard forgets his wife's birthday (in that order). The explosions are owned up by a group calling themselves \"Touchbutton\". Touchbutton is also their weapon, a new line of explosives working on radio waves, smuggled in from Eastern Europe. Duncan Howard, a man obsessed with work, takes it upon him personally to nail the supplier of weapons -- an obsession that creeps into his personal life. Time is short and the terrorists are becoming bolder and bolder. \"Drummer in the Dark\" is not a normal espionage novel. You are not left to wonder who's the Tinker, who's the Tailor, who's the Soldier and who the Spy. There are few characters. Clifford is as focused as single-minded as Howard, so single minded that he disposes of elements such as suspense. \"This is the guy we are up against, this is how he does it, and this is what we will do\", he seems to say. The \"Drummer in the Dark\" is short, focused, and to the point. You get the feel, rightly, that the author knows his domain. However, you do wonder at the flatness of it all at times. The villains, at least the ones we meet, are amateurs, seemingly incapable of coordinated attacks (there is one unnamed \"professional\" at the beginning of the book). Also the \"Drummer in the Dark\" seems to be aiming at a subtle existential statement on how terror destroys the lives of both the perpetrators and the people who fight it. Is the book worth the read?

She was crossing a road when a speeding two-wheeler hit her. The driver had an excuse for himself - he said \"I was in a hurry to get to office\". Are emotions singular? Can one be simultaneously happy and sad? Can you be simultaneously sad about two distinct things? Can one have separate strands of sadness like coiled snakes which wrap over each other, coming together at points, but still being independent? If personal experiences are anything to go by, one can. I did. And one of these snakes pondered on \"hurry\". The Gods know how often I have been in a hurry to reach office. I could have easily been this guy. So could many of you. If my own perception of how thing around me are changing is a valid benchmark, people are, like I am, becoming more and more impatient. Horns, which were made to warn other drivers of someone's presence, are becoming obnoxious tools in the hands of agitated idiots. Some drivers imagine themselves to be Moses, separating out a sea of vehicles to create a path using only their horns.\u0026nbsp; Something about the modern lifestyle makes us to be in such a state. Everything needs to be productive. Every mundane activity deserves a non-mundane adjective to describe it. Travel needs to be enriching. Birthdays need to be explosive (everyone has a blast). Books need to be educative. Weekends need to be fun. Naps need to be rejuvenating. Blogs, except this one, need to be informative. \u0026nbsp;Weddings need to be grand. Schools and colleges need to make \"industry-ready\" individuals. Faces need to be photo worthy. People need to be happy and demonstrative of their happiness. Every minute, every second, every single fraction of a second, needs to be useful. A lot of impatience we seem to have acquired follows from the free market structure. I can definitely feel this in a country like India, where people have just started getting used to luxuries a few other nations take for granted. After all, why sweat on our way to work when folks from Western countries have been travelling comfortably in cars for decades? \u0026nbsp;However, with our population, the ambitions of every one of us to get rich put together will turn out to be destructive. Would Ola and Uber drivers drive so damn rashly if they were not incentivized for completing more trips at a faster rate? \u0026nbsp;As corporates try to squeeze in as much as they can from their employees, work has become the central focus for many of us. We don't mind that we are ignoring people close to us. We don't mind knocking out a couple of people on our way to work. After all, work is worship. With all the progress we have had, we only seem to have more to do. The greatest outcome of modern civilization is that we have advanced tools that make it easier to roll up Sysiphus's boulder at a great speed. However, the boulder still rolls back down. Every single time. I wonder at the purpose of it all. I wish we could drive slowly. In road, and in life.

Being old acquaintances but not close enough to be friends, they greeted each other warmly, stopped by to make a courteous conversation, and wished each other luck before parting their ways. The Hare galloped North, following rumors that a trove of vegetables was discovered about 50 yojanas away. The Tortoise headed towards the river to their east, in pursuit of weeds. Few hours later as the Tortoise made its laborious journey, it heard its name being called out loud. Turning back, it recognized the familiar face of its friend, \u0026nbsp;Samaja the crow. \"Hello, where are you headed?\" \"Hi hello, glad to meet you! I am planning to settle on the river banks, where there's enough supply of weeds to last a few years\" \"Haven't you heard about the news from North?\" \"What news? About the vegetables?\" \"Yes, everyone is headed there. I just saw saw the Hare rushing towards it. Why are you not going?\" \"Oh, that's nice. Personally, I prefer weeds. \" \"What's the matter with you? No one prefers weeds over vegetables.\" \"But I don't like vegetables!\" \"So what? With vegetables, you can buy anything. Even weeds! And it will last a lifetime.\" \"Hmm.. are you sure?\" \"Of course I am sure. Do you think the Hare is a fool?\" \"But he is already halfway through! Before I complete the journey, he would have eaten up everything\". \"Why do you want to give up already? With perseverance, hard work, will and determination, nothing is impossible for a man\" \"Dude, I am female. And I am a tortoise!\" \"Just because you are a female, or because you are a tortoise, are you any lesser than any man? Are you lesser than the Hare?\" \"Of course not.\" \"The what are you waiting for? Run already. Go through the garden of Aneet as it is shorter\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Oh, just here and there\" \"Okay, thanks for your valuable advice.\" Saying thus, the Tortoise chugged along diagonally towards the vegetable patch. Meanwhile, the crow went around the forest, liberally doling out advice, some solicited and some unsolicited, to all its friends. A couple of days later, it happened to be passing towards the vegetable patch when it heard loud snores from a bush nearby. Curious, it flew down, and identified its good friend, the Hare, who had just started stirring a little. \"Hi there! What are you doing here?\" \"Hi, I wanted to sleep\" \"I thought you were at the vegetable patch! Did you find it? It must be only 10 yojanas from here\" \"Huh! I gave up on it. I realized that my passions are more towards sleeping.\" \"That's stupid! Who wants to sleep all the time? Everyone is headed towards the vegetable patch, like wise people ought to be. In fact, even the Tortoise must be quite close to it by now.\" \"The Tortoise? Wasn't he headed towards the River?\" \"He was. He changed his mind. \" \"Heh, doesn't he not like vegetables?\" \"No one in a proper frame of mind ever dislikes vegetables. I say you are wasting your time here!\" \"You think so? Where would the Tortoise be now?\" \"He should be quite close to the vegetable patch.\" \"Hmm, then he will reach there first and eat up all vegetables! I would rather stay here and sleep.\" \"With perseverance, hard work, will and determination, nothing is impossible for a man. And rabbits. Why are you giving up so soon? With your speed, you should outrun her.\" \"Maybe. But are you sure about this vegetable thing?\" \"Completely. You are wasting your time here.\" \"Okay. What do I know? You sound so confident. I better get started\" \"That's great! Good luck.\" \"And hey, thanks a lot. I owe you .\" \"Ahh, forget it. The pleasure is in guiding people to a right path\" So the Hare set off at great speed. The Tortoise, meanwhile, had almost completed it's tedious journey. The vegetable patch was just a yojana away. But the Hare had the advantage of rapidness.\u0026nbsp; So, who won the race? The Hare, or the Tortoise? And more importantly, what happened to the mysterious crow? Well, who the heck cares! I am too busy chasing vegetables.

On our very first day at our engineering college, some fifty of us were asked the question : \"Why did you choose the stream Biotechnology?\" As I almost leapt up to give an answer, the faculty hastily added \"don't say 'sir when I came to counselling, that was the only stream available'\". I was disheartened, as he had highlighted my exact position. In the meantime, a short guy stood up and declared with the confidence of a motivational speaker, \"sir, I always wanted to be a genetic engineer\". It was impossible to not hate and to not like Vaidhyanathan during those days. Hate because he was unwittingly making things tough for the rest of us with his enthusiasm for every single thing, and like because you just had to talk to him to realize that he always meant well, and will go out of the way to help you. \u0026nbsp;Every time a nervous student was called up to the front of the class to speak on something, Vaidhy would urge him/her ahead with his exaggeratedly encouraging nods. I had to generously draw from his willingness to help to get through the Cell Biology paper in our second semester. With him, you just have to start with something like, \"say that again, what is mitosis..\", listen to his long-winded explanation, and find a way to stop him when you have enough to write for three pages. As a writer, Vaidhy explores various topics with a grand vocabulary here. Have a look at his interesting take on V for Vendetta, or his poignant views on Shades of Grey. I gather that he is a more regular writer in Tamil than in English. As soon as I forced him to discover my blog, he diligently went through every post I had written at that point of time and encouraged me to write more. He has been a visitor here on and off since then. I asked him around seven months back to write a post for this blog. Since then, the Freudian Couch has all but gone comatose. Imagine my surprise today when I received a mail with apologies; and an attachment with an extremely crisp and engrossing little write-up! The apologies are unnecessary, Vaidhy. Much thanks for bringing us all here once more.\u0026nbsp; CANCER \"Ancient humans were incapable of advanced levels of communication, their young brains had simply not evolved enough to realize full potential. This led to the use of numerous intermediary devices and tools that helped humans get in touch with one another and share ideas, even survival plans, most of them considered as inventions and innovations at those times!\" Origins 101. Long-nosed Professor was lecturing our class of 30, trying to focus our attention on to the subject by merely moving his big eyes in their even bigger sockets. I have always admired his ability to get us in line without ever having to communicate harsh words or rude thoughts. The glare seemed to land more than occasionally on the bunch of newbies sitting in the last row. \"God damn Transfer Students\", sighed my neighbour, obviously thrilled at the thought of facing those hunks with his barely-boned frame at Football try-outs. \"It was not easy,\" the Professor went on, \"the devices seemed to do more harm than good. To begin with they created a rift amongst the elders and fledglings born into the transitional era, of the races across all primitive tribes, divided by mostly invisible and at times hostile borders. The Elders often complained of a loss of the ability to natively communicate as prominent side effects of the devices. At one point even strange diseases started to plague the humans, the kind they were poorly equipped to understand or deal with at that primitive era.\" I found myself trying hard to know what the cute girls in row 2 are so eagerly conversing about, half-hoping it would be about me, just as the Professor's glance swept past, lingering for a prolonged second. \"You shall read more about that under the section Cancers, in fact, why don't you read it out loud?\" I hurriedly looked up the section and smacked my lips involuntarily before reading the synopsis, \"A condition that manifested with subtle variations targeting different parts of the body, Cancer was one of the prime reasons for resetting the ecological balance by thinning out human population to controlled levels. It originated as a side effect to primitive communication tools, an inability of the human evolution rate to keep up with the technological advances required to deal with abundance of electro-magnetic waves and EM fields, the precursor of brain waves that are the lines of post-nuclear era communication, fondly known as telepathy. The condition or the disorder as primitive humans called it, was last seen in an age where humans had to open their mouths to produce sound waves, an activity referred to as 'TALKING'.\" Before I could go on, I was interrupted by a brief 'BLIP'! As my 1000 year old ancestor would have put it, 'SAVED BY THE BELL!'\u0026nbsp; ","date":"3 June 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/guest-post-series---cancer/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Guest post series - Cancer","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 June 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/guest-posts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Guest Posts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 March 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cricket/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cricket","type":"tags"},{"content":" Dear South African cricket team,\nI haven't been following the ICC cricket World Cup 2015 that diligently. The news of your semi-final loss did reach me though. Yet another loss in an ICC tournament knock-out game. It must be quite depressing. You will have to wait some more until people stop using the C-word. Why does this happen to you every time? Why you? Aren't you talented enough? God knows you are. Ignore those who point out that the only matches you won in the tournament were against Zimbabwe, West Indies, Ireland, UAE, and Sri Lanka, and that you are not as good a team as you are made to be. What do they know? Or are they right? Are you really not good enough? I know how you feel brothers. Trust me, I know how you feel. Two days before my tenth standard board exam paper, I ferreted out an unused copy of R.D Sharma's maths reference book from my dust covered book shelf and started pursuing it with what can be described only as fanaticism. I worked problems after problems, and more problems. When I walked unflinchingly (Note : mild literary license exercised) into the exam hall, was I unprepared? No dear unlucky cricketers, not at all. But then, why was I not able to answer that simple textbook question asking for the area of a frustum? Why did I leave questions worth fifteen marks untouched? Not lack of talent, definitely. Pressure does strange things. Did I give up. would-have-been-champs? Two years later, in my next major trophy, I prepared harder for my twelfth standard Physics board exam. Mind loaded with Van De Graff generators, capacitors, and Doppler effect, I walked into the hall with confident caution. I placed my hall-ticket safely under the desk, and unboxed my lucky blue-pouch. One pair of blue pens, another pair of black pens, a sharp pencil, a pencil sharpener, a 15 cm plastic ruler, and a 30 cm plastic ruler was neatly (more literary license exercised) laid down on my desk. Along with them was my most prized possession, a 3-rupee Fabre-Castle eraser. \u0026nbsp;I started off calmly and steadily, answering two mark questions at a brisk pace. And then, ill-luck befell me. When the invigilator's attention wavered briefly, the guy sitting in front of me turned back, and coolly snatched the fabre-castle eraser. Indecisiveness, dear proteans, akin to what you had when the first drops of unwelcome rain fell at The Oval last week and the names of Duckworth and Lewis were whispered. Should I tap this idiot's shoulders and get back my eraser when the invigilator doesn't look towards me? Would he suddenly turn back? Should I take the invigilator's help? Would he suspect me of writing the answers on the eraser and passing it on? While I was busy trying to find a way out of this dilemma, ABD and co., I had lost time to answer questions worth nineteen marks. I ended attempting for only fifty one marks out of a possible seventy (thankfully, the rest thirty were allocated for \"practicals\").\u0026nbsp; This was when people started attaching the choker tag to me, dearest South Africans. It was unbearable. The very tag drowns down your efforts. I gave up on preparations, and took my math exam two days later placing trust only on my inherent abilities. And I blazed through it, green pyjamas, I blazed through it. Or so I thought. Would people believe me? A vehement no! I met my tuition teacher, and declared that I would get around ninety-five marks. He laughed, he smirked, and he remarked, \"Adarsh, I know you. You would have definitely made some silly mistakes.\". And just like he predicted, the results showed that I had been over-confident about my abilities. When people start losing trust in you, it is not easy to overcome.\nBut let's face it, dear cute South African cricketers, you suck a little. A tiny bit maybe, but there is something wrong with you. I mean not even a single worthy success? Come on guys, even I had my little victories during the unlucky streak I described above. Take this incident I vaguely remember for example. When I was in my first standard, our school decided to celebrate its sports day along with a neighboring school. We were all escorted to the venue, and probably made to do all sorts of things students are made to do. Knowing me, I wouldn't have volunteered for even a single event. But someone had come up with this curious game meant to test both brawn and brain, and I found myself in the middle of it. The rules were like this : a set of students stand in a row, let's say row A, each holding an item on their hand. A set of another students stand some distance behind them in row B, holding another set of items. At the count of three, the kids from row A had to turn behind, run to row B, identify their \"partner\" who has a complimentary item on their hand, hold the partner's hand, and race back to row A. The pair to complete this unnecessarily complicated set of tasks fastest would be the winner. As a five year old me stood clutching some-whatever tightly in my sweaty hands, I took in the crowd of parents, my own among them, surrounding us. Their well-intentioned cheering sounded ominous to me. The whistle was blown, we all turned back and ran towards the other row of children who were waiting with anticipation. Midway through, my brain froze. A choke that would become all-too-familiar in the future was creeping in. My tiny legs refused to carry me any further. And I was not able to make any sense of what was in my hand. A frenzied shout awoke me. It came from the only guy left standing alone in row B. Every other competitor had found their pair. \u0026nbsp;He gesticulated wildly, and beckoned me towards him. As I breathlessly reached him, already having lost a lot of time, he gripped my hands and dragged me in reverse. I was too dazed to protest, but I was too tired to comply. My partner was not a quitter though. He remorselessly pulled me with all the power he could muster (he was one chubby boy), and we were the second fastest pair to reach the finish line. Looking back at that incident, it seems that this was a sign of things to come all through my future. Fate dragging a reluctant me to an undeserved success. So dear Saffers, stop trying too hard. Destiny will make you successful one day, probably when you have stopped deserving it.

I am basing this statement on the fact that we -- almost each one of us -- are filled with half stupidity and half greed : a deadly combination. There are, and there have been a few exceptional people though, who have transcended the average stupidity, and drawn attention to this fact repeatedly. Here is one such; one of my favorites - George Carlin, presented in unusual avatars. Why this sudden love for Carlin, you ask? George Carlin was not only clever, he had enough foresight to predict the future accurately. Not just any future; he predicted his own specific future too. Don't believe me? Have a look at this quote from his book Brain Droppings (Hat Tip : https://www.quora.com/Comedians/Why-did-George-Carlin-always-wear-black#) I'm tired of being unable to buy clothing that doesn't have writing and printing all over it. Insipid sayings, pseudo-wisdom, cute slogans, team logos, designer names, brand trademarks, small-business ego trips; the marketing pigs and advertising swine have turned us all into walking billboards. You see some asshole walkin' by, and he's got on a fruity Dodger hat and a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt. Of course you can't see the shirt if he's wearing his hot-shit Chicago Bulls jacket. The one that only 50 million other loser jock-sniffers own. And since this cretinous sports fan/consumer zombie is completely for sale to anyone, he rounds out his ensemble with FedEx sneakers, ValuJet socks, Wall Street Journal sweatpants, a Starbucks jock strap, and a Microsoft condom with Bill Gates's head on the end of it. No one in this country owns his personal appearance anymore. America has become a nation of obedient consumers, actively participating in their own degradation. My research abilities are inadequate to determine who makes money out of all George Carlin merchandise, but I safely assume that it involves a few \"marketing pigs and advertising swine\".\nTo top it all, the best of the lot I could find online is this image of Geroge Carlin, on a sleeveless shirt.\nCare to find out what George Carlin thought about sleeveless shirts? Watch this video :\n\u0026nbsp; Here’s another male cliché... these guys that cut the sleeves off of their t-shirts so the rest of us can have an even more compelling experience of smelling their armpits. I say “Hey Bruno, shut it down would you please? You smell like an anchovy’s cunt okay? Ughh... not good... ugh... ugh... whoa... not good Bruno, and definitely not for sharing.” Irony just got blended, weaved, bleached, dyed and sold as a T-shirt.

That impression was shattered when I just checked my Goodreads statistics and realized that in sheer numbers, my reading has been pretty ordinary. But in quality, I am proud of some of the books I read this year, and I believe their memories will stay with me for long. I decided to succumb to the December habit of creating unnecessary lists by mentioning the best ten of the lot. 10) The Girl with The Dragon\u0026nbsp;Tattoo\u0026nbsp;by Steig Larsson : This Swedish crime novel has two interlinking stories, one a darkly tragic murder mystery, and another a battle against corporate swindlers. Though the presence of an additional plot is off-putting for a few people, I was fine with it. What surprised me was to learn that women lead dangerous lives even in a country like Sweden. This book made me reconsider a lot of things about women equality. My short Goodreads review is here. 9) The Book Thief by Markus Zusak : Previously reviewed in my blog\u0026nbsp;here. 8)\u0026nbsp;I am the Messenger by Markus Zusak : Two books by a single modern writer in the list! I Am the Messenger is lesser known of the two. It is about unremarkable people leading mundane lives in Australia. It has logical loopholes and an ordinary ending. Fortunately, logic does not affect my choices (in all things) as much as it probably should. I loved this book because of its uniqueness in having an unexceptional guy as a protogonist : a misfit who reads novels and drives taxis. Like Churchill described Atlee, our hero is a \"modest man with much to be modest about\". He has Zusak's sense of humour though. Here is my Goodreads review of I Am the Messenger. I hope to write a complete post about it sometime. 7) Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy : Leo Tolstoy's epic novel, Anna Karenina is not an easy read. But it is the sort of book that you read and ponder upon, and then realize its beauty. With two protagonists who are alike, yet totally different, Leo Tolstoy guides us through the Aristocratic Russian society. We witness a proposal, a marriage (the best literary marriage I have come across), a childbirth, a suicide, a few extra-marital affairs, and numerous intellectual dining room conversations. Another book I might write about some time. Here is my hastily written Goodreads review. 6) Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry : The setting is Bombay of 1972. Gustad Noble is a conservative, religious, yet an open minded Parsi man. His adolescent son is rebelling against him, his daughter is ill, his best friend who deserted him in the past wants him to take part in a clandestine mission for RAW, the Indira Gandhi government at the centre is rumoured to be corrupt, there is war brewing in East Bengal -- soon-to-be-Bangladesh, his new best friend is battling an ailment, a man from his colony creates nuisance in his life, the right-wing RSS is becoming hostile, and the compound wall of his colony has gradually taken the form of a public urinal. In Mistry's skillful hands, Gustad Noble's ordinary circumstances are coloured by Indian-ness. Who cares about the lack of a central plot when we have an engaging tale with a wonderful, warm-hearted hero? Goodreads review here. 5) All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque : The best war novel I have come across. This novel banned by Hitler depicts the brutality of war and its effect on soldiers. The detached tone multiplies its impact. A sad, sad book. Goodreads review here. 5) The Martian by Andy Weir\u0026nbsp;: A science fiction involving an astronaut struck in Mars, narrated with unmatchable wit. The only book I was able to finish this year at a pace I am proud of. Unputdownable. Goodreads review here. Read the book before its movie adaptation is out. 4) The Stranger by Albert Camus : \u0026nbsp;Short and powerful. With an amoral protagonist, Camus questions everything we know about life. This books contains the essence of Camus's philosophy of existentialism. Also, this is the book that taught me my recent-favorite phrase : \"tender indifference\".\u0026nbsp; 2) The Illicit Happiness of Other People by Manu Joseph : Reviewed on my blog here.\n1) Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky : Reviewed on my blog here.\nOutside books, it has been my most memorable year till date. Also, this happens to be the year where I inundated you all with a personal record number of blogposts. I will try not to repeat it :) Thanks for putting up with me. Wish you all a great year ahead!

It was one of these malls where you press a button upon entry to generate a time-stamped parking slip and settle the parking charges while exiting the mall. We were surprised to find on our way in that the vending machine didn't work and, since the gates were open, my friend just drove in. We parked and shopped; my friend and his companion shopped whilst I walked roughly behind them starring at my mobile screen. On our way out, we were stopped and asked for a ticket. The attendant was extremely polite and as soon as my friend explained how we had entered, he was flexible enough to just ask us the time of entry and collect a rough amount. My friend though, was righteously outraged at being asked to pay for a system fault. He did pay eventually, but he kept raging on all the way back home about the missed opportunity to teach the mall authorities a lesson. It must have slipped his mind that he had used the parking facilities, for which it is only natural that he pay. On another day a family I know ordered pizzas from a popular outlet. The pizzas came on time but it was found upon unpacking the boxes that the pizzas were cold. They were about to heat the pizzas on their own microwave oven when it occurred to them that as paying customers, they did not deserve to be treated poorly. They placed a call to the outlet, ignored the apologies, and asked for some sort of compensation. The only way out was for the pizzas to be boxed and sent back to the outlet, when the outlet sent out another dispatch of the same order to be delivered a few minutes later. The family contemplated this, and were coerced by their hunger to simply drop the issue.\nIn my short -- albeit seemingly extremely long -- \u0026nbsp;career, I have not been perfect at my work. In my first year at an IT company, I kept making a series of mistakes. More experienced people stuck with me, and kept giving me more opportunities, and I committed more mistakes. With time , I learnt - not exactly to avoid mistakes -- but to handle them, and to reduce their frequency. When I find other people committing minor mistakes in their own jobs, I feel a healthy camaraderie towards them. \"What, you forgot that? Haha! So, I am not the only imperfect person around.\" Naturally, it amuses me to look at others who expect no mistakes at all when they pay for things.\nOf course, I am not Buddha (despite my occasional claims to that effect). I do get irritated at bad service, and I often take it out on an unfortunate representative. The justification for it is simple : the company makes so much money, why shouldn't they serve me well? But often, we don't hurt the company. Yelling at a pizza delivery guy who is late by a bit doesn't change much. Yelling at the outlet about the tardiness of the delivery guy could reward us with free dinner, but chances are that the dinner is involuntarily sponsored by the lowly paid delivery guy. A phone call to the customer service of any popular telecom company yields only a self-gratification as we harangue a helpless (and irritatingly repetitive) customer care executive. A I-pay-for-it-I-deserve-to-be-treated-better mentality is dangerously close to a class mentality, where class is defined by how rich you are.\nAnd why this obsession with flawlessness -- especially in other people? Every corporate looks towards a zero defect product. Let's face it, most of our jobs are not, for my inability to think of a better term, \"mission critical\" (supplementary question : What is this mission? What is the purpose of human existence?). Most of our jobs are useless, contributing absolutely nothing to humanity. Yet we go around with a demeanor of self-importance as if we are Atlas, bearing the whole brunt of the World on our shoulders. Of course, there are professions that are critical. In the science fiction novel Martian, thousands of NASA scientists work around the clock for the survival of a single man, and despite their stress, they are acutely aware that a single mistake would be costly. Bus drivers (a thankless job), doctors, judges, juries, pilots, certain programmers, safety device manufacturers are a few professions I can think of where perfection is an absolute necessity.\nBut should we really insist a machine-like perfection in every walk of life? Or is it the quest for such perfection that makes humanity what it is today? I seriously don't know. But often, I wish that we just have the ability to take people's imperfections lightly, and be polite while pointing them out.\nPS : In case there are typos in this post, you know what to do.\nImage Source :\u0026nbsp;http://www.customerexperienceinsight.com/customers-said-you-suck-handling-complaints/ ","date":"28 December 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-grass-better-be-greener-on-the-other-side/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The grass better be greener on the other side","type":"posts"},{"content":" Note : This post is a part of the\u0026nbsp;Guest Post Series. A minor setback kept me away for a little from the blog. Now that I am a wee-bit more confident that things outside the blog can be set right, I am back to doing what I like doing the most - forcing you all to momentarily pause your furiously paced life, and make you think about things that would never ever prove useful to anyone. Here is a guest post that has been laying dormant with me for a long, long time, waiting to be introduced by me. Balaganesh was my bench-mate in my first day of college. \"Hi, I am Balaganesh. My friends call me Bala\". For some indecipherable reason, I pointedly addressed him as Ganesh for a few days until I realized that he wouldn't respond to anything other than Bala. He did eventually become one of my better friends. Bala is known for his sense of humour. We all need someone who is willing to play themselves down for the entertainment of others. Bala is one such person. Lots and lots of people feel good about themselves by teasing him, and he lets them -- most of the time. To be fair to them, Bala can be irritating, especially when his attempted jokes are terrible. But sometimes (the success rate is quite low) they come off, with hilarious effect. When asked to submit an assignment in Genetics, the whole class wanted to submit print-outs. Our lecturer was adamant, and wanted it to be hand-written. \"OK, no print-outs. At least Xerox, madam?\", he quipped. Underneath all this, Bala is quite a serious person. A lot of things make him angry. But most of all, that his very good knowledge in politics and current affairs go ignored makes him furious at most people. And Bala reads a lot too. As far as I know, he started reading English novels quite late (but he has been reading in Tamil for long), but devours them hungrily to keep up. Around the time I started to blog, he too started his own blog, and we had an unspoken competition between us. He would write random snippets and send them to me, and as he kept writing, he kept improving. Ignoring some punctuation, there are some enviably well-written snippets, but they are so random that nothing can be made out of them. My favorite piece of writing by him is The King and the Truth, a fine piece of historical fiction. A more suitable example of the randomness in his writing is this.\u0026nbsp;I expected such a post from Bala, but he decided to write a movie review. And on that note, I finally managed to catch up with Interstellar yesterday. The science is beyond me, but I connected with the movie emotionally on so many levels and I loved it for that.\nInterstellar and my 120 Bucks What is a science fiction?\nThe limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;–Arthur C Clarke To evolve base science, futuristic novel ideas in to next level, pushing the boundaries of logic all the while keeping foot on the ground. In short, Imagination with or with in the grasp of logic is science fiction. What is wrong with the movie? Nothing is wrong with the movie. And I have nothing against Nolan; In fact I am a die-hard fan of the Dark Knight series and Prestige, I haven’t watched Inception though, but have heard the same annoying clichés\u0026nbsp;from friends, “Wow whatta movie, I had to watch it 5 times to understand, how can a person think like this” etc.., and I decided against watching it. So, when people who hardly watch or read science fiction speak about ground breaking ideas, new physics Nolan has come up with the movie (Yeah Righttt…); I am like “had physics always been so primitive before Nolan started making movies”, because Space-time continuum, Gravitational Singularities and probable worm holes are the grounds on which any DC or Marvel comic and real ground breaking movies such as the highly acclaimed and unknown to today’s Nolanites such as Akira, 2001:A Space Odyssey, The Solaris or even\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy (People perceive it only as comedy which itself a tragedy)\u0026nbsp;are built upon,\u0026nbsp;so it’s not new level of thinking for many of my friends and me, and I’m naturally and quite rightly annoyed. The movie itself is a delight with the delicate emotional quotient shouldered by Matthew Mcconaughey, Mackenzie Foy (Little Murph), and Jessica Chastain (Murph grown up), excellent if not grand music by Hans Zimmer (The constant hum of Grandeur), thankfully not in latex-Anne Hathaway (Highly Distracting in latex and leather :P:P :) ), Michael Caine who wasn’t used as much as he should have been and last but not the least the TARS and CASE robots weren’t a humanoid but had humor which was kind of cool and awesome, lazed with great lines, Kudos to that. But they too are replicas with improvements from a lot other Sci-Fi’s (I’ll give Nolan the benefit of doubt for not saturating the idea) Now anyone can see the potential of this cast, I’d say their presence in itself guarantees Oscar nominations, so when someone says great acting and music, no surprises there. Note: I refrain from commenting on specific sentiment scenes as I’m prone to giving up the main plot, not that it has many twists, but below this I may not be extending the same courtesy for science will always be science. And if you have not seen the movie by now I assume you ain’t so keen a Nolanite. In terms of Science-Fiction: “What had happened is also yet to happen, what will happen in the future though; had already happened” *And also happening right now* The amazing and widely acclaimed visual effect/treat of the Black hole in fact has over-shadowed the most incredible notion and complexity of the movie. The simultaneity of time, if you watch it closely you will know it never was about time travel but about events occurring simultaneously, it was refreshing to see that Nolan didn’t point it out as in many other Sci-fis but trusted the audience to figure it. Matthew who has travelled in to the space is already present in his daughter’s bedroom but also in the future (Namesake) which also is the past (Namesake). \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Awesomeness of science has been barred by the stunning illustration and effects of the Black hole The place where he ends up is with time as a physical dimension, one can simply take a stroll and end up in his past or into the future, though grandfather paradox would prevent any physical interaction that might impact the events happened/happening. Nolan bypasses it conveniently with Gravity. But all these wonders of physics have been sidelined by the glory of the black hole. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Yet, if I were allowed to be brutally honest for a minute I’d say “it is an overrated Sci-fi, every idea in this movie has been already experimented upon, in better and flawless movies”. We all want our heroes to win, we want all the movies we watch to have happy endings, so naturally laws of physics and logic is betrayed in the script (hardly the qualities you will want in a genuine Sci-Fi), no one (Including Nolan and Kipp) can explain how the three planets are compatible to life in any sense without a nourishing star near but with a black hole (you don’t need a masters to spot this) and the exaggerated effects of relativity like slowing down of time ratios, yes this is intriguing to common minds but to create a perfect sci-fi we’d have expected better explanations than gravity, especially with Kipp thorne by his sides. The only new idea however preposterous, (I will reserve my comments on that) is the suggestion that Love might be a great power which we haven’t really have tried to explore on, by which Nolan is suggesting how Captain cooper ends up being able to help his daughter (It took me great effort to not reveal this scene, though I doubted the possibility when the movie decided to tread upon space-time distortions) And what finally broke my resolve to not be annoyed or write a review on this movie is when Mathew Mcconaughey ejects (The computer actually screams “EJECT”,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;LOL….) and survives from a spaceship being torn apart in to shreds by the gravity of the black hole\u0026nbsp;inside the blackhole, seriously what the hell is that.\u0026nbsp;Oooops spoiler :P:P Conclusion: It’s a great movie, but overrated and with a lot of facts gone wrong (Quite common when imagination is mixed with science, so it’s fine and forgivable in many places) and with fans who worship Nolan and talk non-stop in theatres and clap for not so great scenes while missing the real good ones (Unforgivable), is annoying to real Sci-fi readers and watchers. PS: Black holes are being depicted as friendly and life -nourishing in the movie which is the best(or worse) humor I stumbled upon in the last couple of years :P:P\u0026nbsp;(LMAO) Courtesy: Title from RJ Balaji’s take it easy with Balaji and Arthur C Clarke for the quote.

I do not love ice creams. Please note that I am not saying \"I do not like ice creams\", for I do like them. I know intimately the feeling of looking forward to eating an ice cream. I enter buffet halls with a general plan to concentrate on the desserts. For many an achievement that is major to me but will sound laughably insignificant to the rest of the World, I have asked myself , \"Adarsh, you deserve to celebrate! How about an ice cream?\" My visits to Malaikottai in Trichy are planned such that I always end up at the inimitable Michaels, where you get dead-cheap and yummy ice-creams.\u0026nbsp;I prefer them with chocolaty flavors, and cornetto is my favorite. Lately, I have come to realize the deliciousness of the humble butterscotch too. \u0026nbsp;Yet I do not love them. I have often said no to an ice cream when people around me enjoy one. It comes from the general lack of temptation that I have for food items. It is also due to my permanent cold. Cold for me is what style is for superstar Rajnikant : \"kudave porandhadu, ennaikum pogadhu\" (roughly : it was born with me, and it will never leave me). My mother loves ice creams, and she often tries to tempt me by offering a little from her own cup. \"Come on, just taste it\", she says. I usually refuse. After all, a single tiny spoon of ice cold dessert can aggravate your suffering as much as a large scoop. If I had to eat a single spoon, I argue with her, I would rather eat the whole of it.\nTalking about celebrations, I am happy to announce that I am back home from a country where I have spent most of my last year, and which has taught me a lot. In this tiny country whose existence was unknown to most people until recently (roughly coinciding with my entry there. I did warn you about my superpower), I have learnt a lot, and I have unlearnt a lot. I have changed so much, and yet I remain the same. I have no doubt that this year I spent away from my home country would be among the most significant times of my life.\nI was born in what is considered as the upper class in most Indian places. I read about racism and prejudice only in books. I would nod my head, make \"tcchhh tcchhh\" noises, and carry on. In his wonderful novel The Stranger, Albert Camus describes the way the World treats a single human being : with \"tender indifference\". That's exactly what I had for other people around me. You can make all the right noises, but you don't know racism until you experience it. I have, and I thank this country for it. Claiming that I have encountered racism is probably an exaggeration. Racism is something extremely subtle, and I can confidently claim that we have all been racists at some point of time. Should I even make a big deal of it? I think I must, because what I experienced seems systematic, and I would have experienced more of it if I had been as unfortunate as a lot of others around me.\nWhile on the topic of fortune, I have left a country that showed me how fortunate I have been in my life. Life has been unfairly fair to me. It is so unfair for so many people who do not get a chance at proper education, who end up in such places and put up with exploitation because things back home are much, much worse. I also learnt that speaking good English is not a necessity to communicate well in English. Men of various languages meet everyday and carry out complex tasks with an extremely basic knowledge of English. \"Good ah?\" is a question, and \"good\" is the appropriate reply. \"Problem\" is the question as well as the answer based on the intonation. And most importantly, I learnt the power of money. Money can make a desert land fertile. Nothing is impossible with money. Money can also make one indifferent to suffering of others. Tenderly indifferent.\nYet, I chose to run away from all these to a place that would make me feel better. Is my home any better? A lot of people have argued with me that it is not. There is racism in India, though I am on the right side of the it. There is corruption. There are evil people. There are people who are not evil, but who occasionally \"bend\" a law or two. There are narrow minded people, and there are violent people. The rich decide the policies, and the poor rarely have voice. And I might run away to another place once again if I get the opportunity. But, my personal feeling is that none of this is systematic. There is a possibility, however tiny, that all this will change. Our country is a little less evil than the country I left. If both countries, probably like all other countries, are evil, why should I choose one over the other? Especially if I can make more money in the latter? Because, I have come to realize that there are times when a single spoon of ice cream is not the same as a whole scoop of it.

There is/used-to-be (and hopefully, will-be) an informal movie fest at Chennai, where a group of people meet together once every month and watch movies of a selected genre all through a Saturday night. A terrace would be lent for a night by some kind soul (the fest is temporarily suspended due to scarcity of kind and able souls), and we would adorn it with rented beds on the floor, lie down, set up rented projectors and speakers, and try staying awake all night with movies selected by the \"curator\" of the day for company. Accidentally, I happened to meet a friend at the venue the very first time I attended the meet (it was his first time too), and we decided that we would frequent the Chennai Roof Top Film Festival (Chennai RTFF) as often as possible. The challenge at such an event is not to fall asleep. My friend and I were confident that it would not be a big issue at our second meet, since the theme was \"Sports movies\". We found our curator to be a young college going boy : Pavithran, and our expectations for an action-packed night became higher. Pavithran started the night with a nice 1961 movie called The Hustler. However, my eyelids had trouble staying apart after watching the more-than-two-hour-long, dialogue-based (excellent dialogues though), black-and-white movie where the sport in question is snooker. After a terrible (personal opinion) sleep-inducing paranormal drama called the Field of Dreams based on the unfamiliar Baseball, I lost my cool (especially after this guy shrugged at the end of the movie with a \"You are all speechless, right?\"). My friend struggled to contain my heckling when I learnt that the third movie was based on a real story about a Golf tournament. Thankfully The Greatest Game Ever Played turned out to be gripping and immensely enjoyable. I randomly met Pavithran once again at a movie screenwriting workshop. He didn't recognize me, so I had to introduce myself. Over the two-day workshop, we found that we were largely in agreement about, among other things, \u0026nbsp;the usefulness of the sessions by the knowledgeable movie academic and director K.Hariharan (a keen and a brilliant mind), and the uselessness of the sessions by Kamal Hassan (other than the brag potential, which I have now exhausted). I would have a lot of online conversations with Pavithran later on, debating on various insignificant issues. All this completely reversed my first opinion of him. Pavithran is well-read, and a crazy movie buff. He has interesting perspectives -- for example he believes there is no evil that cannot be redeemed, and thus capital punishment should be abolished. And most importantly, he has the increasingly rare quality of trying to understand the other person's opinion (read as : my opinion), and a readiness to reconsider his opening premise. Check out his reviews of Sudish Kamath's Good Night Good Morning and Prakash Raj's Dhoni. Don't be fooled by his humbleness : he is friends with many a celebrity. I stand corrected : he himself became a celebrity by starring in this briefly viral, and totally wild, YouTube\u0026nbsp;video where his hair is literally set on fire. Recos from a bored Engineering student I used to think I was an excellent writer. I was among the several bitten by the “If Chetan Bhagat could write, so could I” bug. Until I saw how good the others were. I used to blog. I had grown lazy and stopped doing that too. It had been a very long time since I had put pen to paper to write anything. So when Adarsh (anna) asked me to do a guest post, I told him I’ll give it much thought and try to write something worthwhile. Its been 15+ days since he asked and I cant seem to find anything that would inspire me to write. Heck, I was wondering if I had forgotten how to write and went back to my blog to see the stuff I had written. It was embarrassing . I then decided I would do what I did best. Recommend movies \u0026amp; books that I loved and would like others to watch/read too. So here I bring you two of my favourite books and movies. Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil This book has a 2300 word 7 page long prologue. The specialty about it is that the entire prologue is a single sentence. No. You didn’t read it wrong. 2300 words make up one sentence. If there’s a better advertisement for a book I’ve not seen it yet. I consider it among the best works by an Indian author. The Book recreates the Bombay of the 1970s and is as mad as its prologue.\nThe Great Beauty by Paolo Sorrentino This Italian film, on the surface level is a film about nothing. Of course you might want to say that by deciding to be a film about nothing, it is something but, you get the idea. If you were to dig deeper into the film, it is a lot of things. It has a deep philosophy running about it. It is one of those films that is difficult to comprehend in just one viewing. I’ve seen it thrice and it continues to throw up new things that I didn’t notice in the earlier viewing. It is also a film that demands every bit of your attention and patience. A lot of your patience if I might say, like “The Tree of Life”. Omar by Hany Abu-Assad A film from Palestine , this suspense drama thriller packs in friendship , romance, trust or the lack of it, betrayal, rebellion, patriotism in a tight 90 minutes that has your pulse racing with an excellent pay-off in the climax. That the film is set in occupied Palestine contributes to the tension that forms an integral part of the film. Spilling out more would mean spoiling the movie for you, which I don’t intend to do. The Fault in our Stars by John Green No. I haven’t seen the movie version of the book yet. I hope you haven’t yet. Even if you have and disliked it for a sappy romance film, give the book a read. It’s a brilliantly done. This is what I think\u0026nbsp;happened. John Green came up with an unusual , interesting idea for a book. He then decided its not viable commercially because he felt most would not grasp the “idea” and thereby make the book a critical success and a commercial failure. He then works on the idea and improves it. The improvements to the idea, are so well thought out, the book is now both a critical and commercial success. What did he do? Read the book and you would know. Cheap Thrills by E.L.Katz This English black comedy is about one mad night where two friends come together after a long time and indulge in several of activities (cheap thrills) that go from being funny to bizarre before reaching incredulous levels. Though on the surface level it would seem to be a film that offers cheap entertainment, it is much more than that. It offers some serious bleak commentary on the society at large.\u0026nbsp; Blue is the warmest Colour by Abdellatif Kechiche A French lesbian romance film that depicts teenage first love and the heart-break that follows it is excellently captured on screen. Though 180 minutes long, considering every second of the runtime contributes to the run time, you would never feel its length. Winner of the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival last year (awarded by a jury that was headed by Steven Spielberg) It is considered amongst the best romance films to have come out last year. One of my personal favourites.\u0026nbsp; If you’ve already watched/read the above movies/books and feel differently, do mention in the comments. If you do watch/read the movies/books after reading about them on this blog and love or\u0026nbsp;hate it afterwards, do mention in the comments. Am always up for a discussion.\u0026nbsp; Until next time then...\nA.Pavithran ","date":"2 November 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/guest-post-series---recos-from-a-bored-engineering-student/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Guest Post Series - Recos from a bored Engineering student","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"26 October 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/justice/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Justice","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 October 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/politics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Politics","type":"tags"},{"content":" Certain things that I came across in the past few days led me into deep contemplation of a sort I was unable express properly. And then, I discovered a video that clarifies a lot of what I had been wondering about, and expresses my worries better than I could ever do. First, let me try to trace the triggers that made me consider things I may not be doing anything about anytime soon. I discovered a totally worthy way of spending time when I came across a Podcast channel called OpenSource. It is hosted by one Christopher Lydon, who seems like a great guy. He is knowledgeable, polite, and capable of firmly stopping his guests if they begin to rant. His guests have excellent credentials, and he seems to know his guests well. In fact, he the sort of person I wouldn't mind seeing as an expert guest himself. The first podcast I listened to is titled \"Is Capitalism Working?\", the short answer being \"No\". Just look around you; you must be deluded not to notice. If you are born poor, you don't have many chances of making it big. There are odds, but the odds are low. People with money invest in a corporate, and the corporate runs solely to satisfy these investors. Customers, employees and society come far behind, often in that order. People with money make more money. \u0026nbsp;This Podcast touches upon issues such as loss of job through outsourcing, government policies that favour the rich and so on. But as a dignified debate, it ends in a subdued manner with a hope that things would become better. Sometimes, what else can one do other than hope? We slog hours and hours for other people to make money, as long as they let us make some of it too. To stop and to consider our situation itself demands sacrifices we are not willing to make. I am of course typing this from an expensive gadget. Did you hear about the newest version of it they have released? It seems damn expensive, but I want to buy it. So that I can listen to more such podcasts in better quality.\nThe other podcast I listened to is titled \"End of Work\". Random Fact mentioned in the show: If Eastman Kodak company shuts down, which is a real possibility, thousands of jobs will be eliminated. Instagram, a somewhat modern version of the Kodak company, employs thirteen people. The End of Work podcast discusses the possibility that we are at the most defining moment of human kind since the Industrial Revolution; Industrial revolution was about machines replacing muscles, the digital revolution is about machines replacing brains. One of the guests is a top researcher from Google who speaks optimistically that by 2030, we would have artificial intelligence (he thinks the term is a misnomer), and men will be allowed to pursue more artistic and \"gratifying\" jobs. He points out rightly that such fears of people losing jobs accompanied the Industrial Revolution too, but things turned out really well for humanity. He reminds us of the thousands of people who contribute immensely to the wealth of the internet all while sitting at home. Chris Lyndon casually mentions that most of these people don't earn money, to which the Google scientist replies that things such as education won't cost as much as it did, and internet and modern innovations like 3D printers will reduce the importance of money. He shrugs off questions on whether we can carry with us the whole of humanity in this revolution, and seems happy enough that we will have gratifying things to do instead of monotonous labour. We can safely assume that a lot of these gratifying jobs involve talking to machines : in other words, programming. No wonder an employee of Google finds it gratifying -- to be honest, I find it that way too, at least as long as I am doing it well. But what about you? I have extremely intelligent friends who don't think much of programming. What about the rest of humanity? Can we dare to assume that they will all enjoy such a World? Will they be able to adapt, or will they be left behind?\nI was talking to this person from Bihar a couple of weeks back. We had to get across using my broken Hindi and his barely survivable English. Over the last year, I have discovered that language is not as important to communication as I thought. This person, much older than me, is a technician. There are a lot of them around the World, but I had not been aware of their existence in my closed IT circles. Technicians of this particular brand are not highly educated, but they are specialized in certain day-to-day industrial operations that involve a lot of manual work. Some of them, not very inaccurately, believe that they are critical to the operation of a whole industrial plant. If at all they get jobs back home though, it will pay them paltry sums. They come abroad to richer countries in search of jobs. When they get them, they hold on to them, braving difficult physical conditions and minor to outright exploitation. They visit their homes for about a month every year. There are people who have been a long, long time. Someone staying here for, say, 12 years, has spent one year of that time with his dear ones. Money is important. \u0026nbsp;This guy mentioned that his father had been in the army, and that he had once been a student of a Kendriya Vidyalaya. Kendriya Vidyalayas are a chain of Government schools created predominantly for wards of Central Government servants who have transferable jobs. They are extremely, unimaginably inexpensive. They usually don't have entrance examinations, they don't filter out \"poor performers\" with as much vehemence as expensive private schools, and they generally take it easy. Yet, they are remarkably effective. I told this guy I am from a KV too, and encouraged him to speak more. He hesitated visibly, and shiftily changed the topic. A few minutes later he added that he had been in a KV till his 7th class, when he had to go back to his village. \"Financial problems\", he said. As if that explains everything. It does, and it doesn't. It doesn't because I have never known it. I hope I won't get to know it too well too. I hope that because I am pathetic. Despite recognizing that the World is an unjust place where money plays a vital role, I still remain a part of the very system that is corrupt and skewed against people who are just unlucky. There are people more pathetic than me though, who are not even willing to concede that the World is unfair. I look at them and sometimes wish I can be as deluded. A couple of months back I saw this video of cocoa farmers tasting chocolates for the very first time in their lives (watch video below). People who produce the source for chocolates do not even know what becomes of their efforts. I would learn later that this is one type alienation predicted by Karl Marx for capitalist societies. Will these people be able to taste chocolates once again in their lifetime? What about other symbols of human progress then; televisions, air-conditioners, computers, internet, smart phones, Google glass, the iOS experience? When will they experience such things the rest of us have come to take as granted? Capitalism is not working. Technology is not trickling down to everyone. Too many scientists are spending too much money on things we don't need, leaving too many marketers to try and make us want them. Charitable institutions such as Google and Facebook are trying to correct this by taking internet to all of humanity. The hungry can then stare at Instagram photos of food to quench their hunger.\nOn the other hand, meet Bryan Stevenson. I chanced upon this video by an accident (watch video below). With shocking statistics on how the American justice system systematically works against certain races and the poor classes, he explains why technological progress is next to nothing if we are leaving humanity behind. Congrats Bryan! You are an inspiration. You seem to do something about issues most of us ignore and the rest of us only talk about. Take a bow! I clapped for you. I spent some time of my life to contemplate yours. Heck, I even wrote a blog post on you. But, I need to move on now. On that note dear readers, can somebody please suggest ways to monetize this blog, preferably without intrusive ads? You see, I am facing this unique problem of wanting more money that I need.\nImage Source : http://humboldtsentinel.com/2013/05/01/calvin-explains-modern-capitalism/ ","date":"26 October 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/stop-shrug-and-fly-you-fools/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Stop, shrug, and fly, you fools!","type":"posts"},{"content":" Note : This post is a part of the\u0026nbsp;Guest Post Series. Since my mother is a teacher, she would often end up meeting other teachers from my school. It would soon be discovered that a few of these people had been my own teachers. As a result, I would occasionally get trapped into a conversation with some long-forgotten faces when I am not adequately prepared for it (it is always advisable to prepare before meeting a teacher), and there would be an awkward moment when they\u0026nbsp;unsuccessfully\u0026nbsp;dig deep into their memory to summon up an image of me. They would then give up, and ask me, \"which batch were you in?\". \"Srini's batch, ma'm. Srinivas\". \"Ahhh, yeah. I remember him! What is he doing now?\" That is the extent of Srini's popularity, and that is the extent of my invisibility. I know Srinivas for about fifteen years. My school was at a walkable distance from my house, and I would go by a shame-inducing ladies cycle when I didn't walk. Srini and another guy traveled from and to what seemed like a great distance to the tiny us, usually by city bus. I once suggested that they walk the other way towards my home for a few minutes so that the buses are emptier, and they crazily agreed. I don't remember even a single topic we discussed all those days walking back, other than some stray incidents. Like that occasion when we tried flagging an auto for a lift only to be berated by a furious auto-driver who demanded money from us. Or the other one when Srini and N unexpectedly got a lift towards my house leaving me all alone. Panic drains shyness. I glanced around quickly, jumped into a random two wheeler driver which had happened to stop by, and urged him to drop me. He was too stunned to protest. I digressed there! I do that often. I am wont to lose concentration, but Srini is not. When he sets his mind on a thing, he usually gets it done. It is not wise to tell him that he can't do something, for he will soon prove you wrong. During our final couple of years at school, he travelled nearly a couple of hours every second day to prepare for his entrance exams. His efforts paid of as he got into one of the most prestigious chain of institutions in India. And college is the best place to start a blog. He started with the very impressive My First Post. The impact this post has had on me is such that for an idea that I am hoping to pen soon, I have been subconsciously telling myself that the opening must be as dramatic as this post. And how did he help my own writing? When we were around 11 or 12, three of us worked briefly on a collaborative novel : a disgustingly pathetic attempt at writing. I hope to tell more about this on a later day, if I get this third person to write for me. Srini and I haven't really been in touch lately. When I pinged him abruptly and asked him to write though, he didn't hesitate even a wink. Within hours of requesting him, I had in my mailbox this meta post on the process of writing. On Writing “Old Habits die hard”…. Well how old should the habit be, so that it doesn’t die?!? Sometimes I wonder, having finished a quarter of the life I am blessed with, how many things from the past should I take forward for the rest of my life. So, when I look back I see there are two most precious things that would invariably come with me no matter what – Memories and habits! Memory Memories are developed by learning, so it primarily consists of knowledge. Habits Habits are developed by doing, so it primarily consists of actions! Cool, so why do I have to take them with me?\u0026nbsp;Aren't\u0026nbsp;they heavy?!? Will they be useful? Will these make me sad or happy? Can I cash on these? The words memory and habits are referred to differently depending on the phase of life we are in.\u0026nbsp; I wish to bucket them into four phases: [1-25] Early in life we call them lesson and studying. [26-50] Later, we quantize it and call it knowledge and skill. [51-75] It then moves on to become just one thing : experience, this is when I think you can think and act seamlessly. [76-100] There is not much action now, so its all just memories L I am not sure if you will agree to this generalization, but after much thought and associating how people (I have met)in these phases of their life project themselves, I am pretty convinced that this framework is okay! Also, I firmly believe that 1.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Every action is a consequence of a thought. 2.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Every thought evolves from learning. 3.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; And you learn when you do! This is yet another cycle of life, but we cannot dismiss it without understanding the beauty of it. Because this cycle goes uphill and if we do not pedal, we fall. Wait. Do not proceed, but reflect on the framework once again [at least till you get convinced]. So, what am I rambling and what is the relevance to the title of the post?!? When Adarsh asked me to write a guest post, I simply couldn’t say no! I liked the concept. So I started writing this one thinking “old habits die hard!” I took it up as an opportunity to give a nice come back. Then, I went into the classic writer’s dilemma – what do I write about today?!? My mind raced from the facts I read from some books this month, the movie I saw yesterday, to my office, to the world of software development, life as an engineer , Bangalore, India, to people I have met, schoolmates, role models, food, economy and many more I am not mentioning here …. But, then I realized something… This framework I talked about, is the realization. I should confess that I have not written anything but thousands of lines of production code, almost equal amount of status mails and nothing more, in the last four years. I am appalled by how much we “watch” instead of “read” and how much we “talk” instead of “write”. If this is what technology does to us, then I fear old habits will die hard! So my answer to those questions: There is nothing good or bad. There is nothing useful or waste. Yes, your thoughts and actions make you feel happy and sad. They can get you money and they might not. But, its only them, who come with you in this long journey. I think I missed a few pedals in this journey. But, if you enjoyed reading this post, maybe I am gasping but am still riding on… Thank you Adarsh for making me do this!

While attending the induction training at my first job, I would wake up every morning quite early, walk a little, take a share auto, take a thirty minute bus ride, and then take another sixty minute bus ride to reach my training centre. Uncoordinatedly, Arun would be usually end up in the same bus towards the end of my journey. He was from my college but we had just met. We would occasionally discuss film making and leave it at that. Much later, thanks to Facebook, I discovered that Arun holds views that are similar to mine on things such as purpose of life, or the lack of it. I don't exactly remember how he became a reader of the blog, considering that the first post I remember showing him was a movie list that I am not too proud off. But he did. And soon, both of us started exchanging random write-ups and story ideas for each others' feedback. We both expect each other to be brutally frank when required and he has helpfully dished out a few of my story ideas which had false starts. Arun is a big movie fan, a photographer, and a traveler. He reads a lot too, and spends much of his time reading on subjects such as psychology and philosophy. His book recommendations -- The Bhagawad Gita and comics by Alan Moore -- are high up on my to-read list, and I will start with them as soon as I trust myself to be able to interpret them not-too-wrongly. Arun gives you perspectives you will never have by yourself. Check out his post Anamoly, where he questions our trivial lives. Read his mind-boggling The Loop System, which can have zillions of interpretations. Or read Statistical Miracle, his passionate (and uncharacteristically direct) plea for treating women well. He has a fantastic interpretation of the Lord of the Rings, and you can have a sneak peak at it in his short poem Of Sauron and the Untold Story. In what seems like an alien characteristic for a subtly-attention-craving me, he has written wonderful things he does not intend to show to a lot of people. And more trivially, he is capable of typing out whole stories on his mobile while travelling in Chennai city buses. Arun's writings demand attention from and challenge you as a reader. He intentionally leaves large parts of his initial idea unwritten, forcing you to fill in the blanks. He is a big fan of open endings. \u0026nbsp;If you want a story not to be completely dished out by him, just take out the climax and mail it to him. Along with Shyam and Vidhya, he is also a part of the short story collection we are looking to self-publish; for which he has penned down a futuristic psychological thriller and is working on a fairy tale. This metaphorical and imaginative write-up is by itself a great example of Arun's writing, so read on. From Hell She stood there unperturbed, in front of the burning gates of hell. She was not at all moved by the ominous sight it presented. She had seen worse. The golden flames burnt away everything at sight. There were no roses, no trees and no gold. There was a gate, black and ominous and then there was fire and more fire, at the end of which were two thrones. She stood alone in front of the gate and she stood there as though she were going to drag the devil out and shoot him. Of course she was in that kind of a mood. This visit was not planned, she was forced into coming out and seeing the devil. At a very young age that too, she had no tea to serve this time.\nHell was empty, everybody went to heaven. God had been forgiving, very much so. The sinners of heaven were thrown out and they finally made their way down to earth. Earth was full of them now. Even hell would reject them, ask Irene, she would tell you. She flung open the gates and stood unfazed as the burning coal ate away at her feet. \"I hurt people, I make people cry and I enjoy doing it. I play with people's souls, make scars that never heal. Whenever I am alone I think about this and laugh. And I am alone most of the times\", said he and started to laugh. \"Are you the devil?” she asked \"Yes\", he answered \"Are you the epitome of evil\" She had been asked where she wanted to be, heaven or hell. She did not bat her eyelid even once when she said hell. Everybody is given a choice, and everybody chooses heaven, everybody wants to reform, everybody don't. \"Lucifer!” She shouted, she was not older than 14 maybe. \"Come on out you dirty devil\", she shouted again \"Who dares open my gates and wake me from my deep slumber\", cried Lucifer \"It’s me Irene, your bride to be. Come forth Lucifer, marry me, consume me, now\", she ordered There was deep laugh from within. \"I am very ugly\", said Lucifer. \"I have seen worse\" answered Irene \"I torture people\", said Lucifer. \" I have seen worse\" answered Irene \"I do not respect women”, said Lucifer. \"I have seen worse\" answered Irene Irene hung her head down and in a low voice asked, \"Do you rape women?\" Puzzled, Lucifer asked, \"What is that?\" Irene stood up, tears rolling down from her eyes and said, \"I have seen worse\" \"You call yourselves a devil, aren't you ashamed of yourselves? While you were deep in slumber, many have surpassed you\", She said sadly. Lucifer began to stutter, \"What, What do you mean?” he asked \"Yes\" \"Do you want to know what real evil is\" \"Yes, yes, yes\", he shouted \"Make way for me Lucifer, let me take that throne beside you\" With fire gleaming in her eyes, she seemed crying down fire. She turned back and said in a high monotonous tone. \"Open the gates of hell, you may, And I shall show you the way, For I have some hatred to share, Each and every one of them I shall bare. They tore me apart, those men, These evil started from whence, I have seen them, their souls they sell, It’s not you, I am the one coming - From Hell\" ","date":"21 October 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/guest-post-series---from-hell/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Guest Post Series - From Hell","type":"posts"},{"content":" Note : This post is a part of the\u0026nbsp;Guest Post Series.\nMeet Vidhya, another contributor for a short story collection a few of us are hoping to publish soon. You have already met Shyam, and you will be meeting the one remaining contributor soon. Vidhya has been reading my blog for less than a year, but she is one of my best readers. She quickly went through almost every nook and corner of the blog when she discovered it, and has since then let me know her thoughts on every single post I have written. On a few occassions, she is the only person getting back with her views, dispelling my doubts that I was deluded into thinking I had published something. It helps that she is a wonderful person, rarely capable of discouraging anyone other than herself. For an awesomely entertaining writer, Vidhya started blogging very late. \"Random House Publications - Random stuff written from my house\" : these are the title and tagline of her blog. And as you come to expect from the tagline, the posts are hilarious. In\u0026nbsp;A bottle of horlicks and a spoon, you will be busy laughing, sniggering and smiling at the jokes until you are hit by the beautiful idea behind the post. In Driving Woes, she makes you squirm at the thought of being anywhere in her vicinity when she is driving an automobile (despite her hastily added assurances to the contrary). And in Animals and their whims, she talks about her inexplicable (for me at least) love for cats, dogs and few other animals. I hope that you would be able to read her stories soon, and be as shocked as I was while encountering the unexpected mini-tragedies she manages to sneak in. I have felt that Vidhya's humour works because of her tone. It gives an impression that she is completely unaware of the humour in her writing. There is also an air of mock-pompousness; she is anything but pompous in real life. She does this really well while writing about children, caricaturing people based on their minor quirks. I requested her to try and showcase this aspect of her writing, and she managed to do exactly that by recalling this rollicking incident from her childhood. God's Own Guests Looks like Adarsh has decided to scoot over and make room for people on his Freudian couch. It’s a nice place this couch .Mostly because the choice of reading is quite good .Ranging\u0026nbsp; from the ridiculously complicated yet funny flowcharts, treatises on names , excellent book reviews and the philosophizing about entropy, about science , morality and Sam Anderson etc.(Wait Anderson? Cant be.. Mendes? No. Definitely Sam someone). The guest post series got me thinking, about guests.So today on the couch , you will hear from me , a story from my childhood . One that involves guests. The fundamental question on guests is of course “How many is too many?” . One or two is ok right? Alright, I guess a small family of say perhaps four is acceptable too. What’s the maximum number of guests you’ve had at home ?Don’t count the time when someone was getting married. On a nice and\u0026nbsp; lazy , month long school vacation, when you’re usually expected only to eat your meals on time , have a bath regularly and not be a menace to your mother, have you ever suddenly found your house inundated\u0026nbsp; with guests you couldn’t count with fingers from both your hands? I have.. We were forewarned of course, my brother and I. A strange bonding had developed between us in anticipation of our shared misery. The day my father told us that we would be having 17 people from God's own country to stay with us for a week our voices rose to the same pitch. We screamed the same questions to our father. \"who are these people\", \"do we even have that many relatives\", \"where will they sleep\", \u0026nbsp;\"how many kids are there in the group, and more importantly \"do they watch the same cartoons as us?\" . Father tried to answer our questions patiently. I'm sure he made reasonable arguments. We didn't hear any of it. We were too shocked thinking about the prospects. One vacation week without our daily dose of cartoon network was not something we were accustomed to and\u0026nbsp; none too eager to find out what it would be like . My brother had a little bit more to worry about . He was the proud owner of a noisy contraption which he would plug in to the TV to play Mario and TMNT for hours on end .\u0026nbsp; He was not able to bring himself to imagine God's own children getting their hands on it. It was his\u0026nbsp; life line.\u0026nbsp; He did not reckon he can survive for long without it , so stowing it away for a week was not a viable option. So there we were, a pair of spoiled brats, who didn't usually get along very well but suddenly we found ourselves on the same side of the battle front.\u0026nbsp; Unwilling as we both were to share material things ( such as the TV remote, the sofa , the distinctly demarcated regions of the bed ) with each other , we were even more unwilling to have to share them with anyone else, let alone a whole circus troupe. We watched silently as our parents looked worried too , wondering\u0026nbsp; anxiously about how we were to accommodate that many people. My brother became excited all of a sudden and wanted to join in this discussion.\u0026nbsp; He rushed out of the room and returned with an exam pad , some papers and a pen.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He beckoned to me. I was absolutely thrilled to be a part of whatever he was planning. He mostly never includes me in things he did. He began to roughly sketch a plan of the house. He quickly verified the demographics with my father\u0026nbsp; again. \"How big is child no 1?, how tall is adult no 12? Are you absolutely sure its 17 ?”.etc. Of course my father had only a vague idea . His patience was evidently wearing thin and we thought it would be best to get out of his sight. We moved our conference to the adjoining room. My brother intended to chart out all the spaces in our house that were \u0026nbsp;unoccupied by furniture and other sundry items that make up a household. He told me that we were going to help our parents by coming up with a Master floor plan that would allocate\u0026nbsp; sleeping area to all of the guests. We were both completely excited and we spent days planning it. No nook or cranny was spared. We heard talk of a baby being a part of the troupe and assigned the staircase landing area for it. We felt mighty proud of ourselves and went around importantly like civil engineers, examining the floor, bending over it , trying to wear intelligent expressions\u0026nbsp; , knocking on the floor checking the amount of noise generated, measuring random spaces with our mother's inch tape and so on. When the day finally came, two mini vans squeezed in with difficulty into our tiny street and disgorged our guests.\u0026nbsp; The days and hours spent in anticipation of their arrival had failed to prepare us for the stupendously spectacular sight they presented.I was\u0026nbsp; stumped into silence by their sheer number. They were all uniformly in a state of excitement that probably rivalled those of the electrons in the outer most circle that your chemistry teacher claimed was the \"highly excited state\". They spoke to each other loudly and happily\u0026nbsp; in a tongue that would remain an unintelligible song\u0026nbsp; despite the number of times I would hear it. It was evident that they were enjoying each other's company. I recall vaguely that my mother braved the task of making idlis for everyone on the first day. Enlightened by the experience, she had my father buy all the remaining\u0026nbsp; meals of the day from the nearby Sangeetha hotel.\u0026nbsp; They all ate contentedly amid loud ruckus and made themselves at home. My brother and I soon witnessed our lazy vacation routine fall apart dramatically. Asianet would be on all through the day instead of cartoon network , where more people sang as they spoke. The video game set was not spared too. It was taken over by the\u0026nbsp; youngest and the loudest . They seemed very well acquainted with the tiny man climbing the endless walls and whenever he fell we would hear one of them disappointedly exclaiming that he had indeed hit\u0026nbsp; the jump button and continue attacking the controls on the joy stick long after \"game over\" flashed on the screen .\u0026nbsp; My brother managed to elbow his\u0026nbsp; way through and joined in defiantly, claiming ownership rights. Later that evening , after everyone was well fed and there was nothing to do but sleep , my brother and I proudly presented our master plan to our parents. My father was dumb struck and we initially thought that was a good thing. He definitely had to be impressed with the level of detail. Undeterred by the lack of vocal reaction from him or our mother, we enthusiastically dragged them about the house showing them exactly what we had planned. We began to debrief the guests\u0026nbsp; too, quite pompously I might add. But for once none of them had anything to say. Or sing. One of the adults in the group suggested that they would all camp at the terrace and everyone agreed with mild sighs of relief. So that was that. The grand plan that had mighty potential and could have saved the world even, was unceremoniously chucked. Forlorn was I to see all the hard work go to waste but my brother? He didn't care . He simply went back to his video game.\u0026nbsp; So that's the end of the story . Perhaps there's a moral there somewhere ? Anyone who has spotted it can let Adarsh know. I'm sure he will be kind enough to pass it on. Until next time on the Couch!

Travel sounds so romantic. But the truth is that not all of us are built for travel. Anyone can be a tourist, but only a few of us are cut out to be travelers. What most of us actually want is to have some cool photos snapped at photogenic locations that tell the World how happy we allegedly are. A true traveler enjoys the journey as much as the destination, if not more -- and takes back memories and lessons that will last longer than any photograph can. Not always consciously, but definitely. Take this \u0026nbsp;post on how Shriya wanted very badly to visit Mont-Saint-Michel\u0026nbsp;in Normandy. The post ends a bit anti-climatically with her not being able to reach her destination, but the journey of reading it is by itself enthralling; mirroring her own journey. Shriya has been a long time reader of this blog. Since I had't written a lot in the first few years of the blog, it is fair to say she is a regular visitor who has read more posts than most readers. She does not always read the posts as soon as they are published, but she does read them eventually. She also takes the time to let me know when she finds what I write to be interesting, or when it makes her think; whilst staying politely silent about posts she can't relate with. \u0026nbsp; I have rarely been able to describe physical objects, and I feel jealous of people who can do that well. Shriya has an enviable vocabulary, and she uses it to write excellent (that adjective is the limit of my vocabulary) travelogues. It helps that she travels a lot, that she reads a lot, that her travels are not confined to normal tourist spots, and that she does not seem to visit these places with a tourist's routine. The nicest thing about her travelogues is that they are not impersonal. They invariably have some personal anecdotes retold with a cautious humor that makes them very enjoyable. Add some gorgeous photos, and you always end up feeling a compelling desire to visit the places she describes. She is also a Couchsurfer, and she explains about it in her post The Couchsurfing Experience\u0026nbsp;(On a side-note, couchsurfers are very active in India too). I proudly feel that this guest post is one of her best amongst the ones I have read. You can check out a few more. There is\u0026nbsp;De-vine valley of the Rhine\u0026nbsp;about the Rhine valley of Germany\u0026nbsp;, Of culture, character and codfish\u0026nbsp;about a little known Portugese city,\u0026nbsp;and her posts on Scintillating Sintra. She also writes non-travelogues, such as 'Not-so-silly' putty\u0026nbsp;which explains a part of her line of work, and my personal favorite : Rückkehrunruhe\u0026nbsp;where she relives childhood memories that all of us have experienced. Reflections On our recent trip to Bordeaux (France), a friend and I decided to amble around the city one night, after our hearty meal. We were visiting Bordeaux on a quick getaway. The only things I knew about Bordeaux prior to the visit were that its lush vineyards provide some of the world’s finest wines, and that a large part of the city is a World Heritage site. A quick scan through travel guides confirmed that I wasn’t forgetting anything special. Or so it seemed. As we strolled along in the chilly night, chance occurrence brought us to a large square in front of majestic French architecture. A central fountain was flanked on an entire side by symmetrically aligned buildings. Apparently built in the 18th century, the buildings now house the ministry of Commerce. Aglow with amber tints, contrasting the darkness of the clear night sky, the setting made for a pretty picture. The square, called Place de la Bourse, spacious in its own right, was one of the nicest I had seen. As I stood there taking photographs, I noticed how there was an effect of mist on the other side of the main street, across the fountain. A fuzzy haze in the darkness, something seemed amiss. We walked towards the sound of children’s laughter and the patter of tiny feet. As we crossed the street, shadows of children running amidst the fog soon emerged. Why was there a localized mist? The mist quickly faded away, and then we noticed where it came from. Many orifices were evenly distributed across the expanse of the ground ahead of us. They soon began to slowly release water, uniformly forming a film along the entire length of the floor. As I looked back to view the buildings that were now behind us, we guessed their purpose. Reflections. By creating a really thin film, a water mirror could provide for the reflection of the entire square. ‘Genius, pure genius’, my friend muttered beside me, while I cursed myself for lack of a better camera. We stood there, at the edge of the film, settling into a comfortable silence. Keeping our eyes peeled while waiting for disruptions to cease. Waiting for meek water to stop being slave to gusty winds. Winds that created ripples on the surface, causing light to scatter into a thousand little sparkles. Sparkles that would recombine at will to form a whole image. The loose nature of its fleetingness took my breath away and left me with goose-bumps. Like a reminder: Sometimes, you need to wait for beauty to show. We oft caught glimpses of the complete reflection of the square: graceful fountain flanked by beautiful buildings. Serenely motionless in time, stubbornly contrasted by cars zipping by. The sight was made more magical when people occasionally walked across the film. The brazen sprint of a child, or the gentle, barefooted gait of a couple. Like Gods walking on water, creating their own reflections while crudely deforming another. I was left feeling a lot of things that night. About how we don’t take the time to notice the gratuitous beauty around us. Catch a sunset. Listen to the sound of the rain. How, more often than not, we’re so involved in mundane routine, that we’re blind to obvious moments that can create feeling. Place de la Bourse reminded me that some of the nicest memories are created by chance. It’s ironic how things we might remember for years to come stem from incidents that were given no prior thought. The unpredictability of the moment leaves quite an impression. To wholly embrace the present and know that there are lifelong memories being created now! Maybe that’s something worth reflecting on… ","date":"14 October 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/guest-post-series---reflections/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Guest Post Series - Reflections","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 October 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/travel/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Travel","type":"tags"},{"content":" Note : This post is a part of the\u0026nbsp;Guest Post Series.\nSupriya was my schoolmate, but we barely knew each other at school. She ended up at the same college as I, but we would still exchange only a word or two when we came across each other occasionally. I did know that she writes poetry and started publishing them online around the time I started writing, but she was totally unaware that I blogged. I don't remember how (I suspect I asked her to read it. How else?), but she stumbled upon the blog. Around a year and a half back, she was one of the most frequent readers, reading posts at a stretch and encouraging me. It was around this time that I decided to make my blog more about me, regardless of what I end up revealing about me and regardless of how boring it is to the readers. Her feedback -- especially when I wrote intensely personal posts such as The Depression Flowchart -- helped me a lot in making this shift. I would call Supriya a feminist, but I believe she is a fierce individualist first. She has strong views, and rarely hesitates to voice them. She also keeps surprising me with things I keep discovering about her. She is an outdoor type, but she is also a voracious reader, reading books at a furious pace and writing in multiple languages. She is, literally, a rocket scientist. She pens poems on extremes of joy and hope, extremes of grief and despair, and on other trivialities in between. She writes prose too, but not as frequently. Her prose often gives an impression that it is meandering, but there are profound observations and glimmers of humour hidden in them. When I asked her to write for me, she was not able to summon up the inspiration to write anything. She wanted me to post something she had already written, and suspected that not a lot of people had read. I would have chosen the stunningly pessimistic Tunnel of Downfall, or the lovely Tell Me. I would have published Spring\u0026nbsp;which is so unlike what I know of her, or the colourful Paint Me a Picture. I loved I Wish, and A Void\u0026nbsp;which is filled with so much anguish that it made me squirm. There is A Moment\u0026nbsp;which captures the beauty of the World, the passionate\u0026nbsp;You, and the exhilaratingly happy A meeting with a star. Talking of happiness, there is this profound essay-- Can I dry clean my melancholy suit, please? on the importance of feeling a little melancholy now and then, with which I completely agree. But Supriya bossed me around (she is capable of doing that to stronger minds than mine) into choosing a poem I haven't been able to decipher completely. She feels it to be her best work till date, despite (because of?) it being as abstract as her. So, on her request/command, here is Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy Last summer I often saw you near the pier prickling my skin like poison ivy Shooting memories into my veins where have I seen you before? may be some other life a different time Intangible as a shadow\u0026nbsp; you appear dark inside or do you shade me?

I received only a couple of feedbacks, and both were negative. Apparently, I took a harmless story too seriously, and got too worked out about it. I should have ignored the story, or atleast cut the story some slack. And the post was unnecessarily sure of itself, unlike most of my other posts. The feedbacks were exactly what I needed. I do get needlessly frustrated seeing certain things. Flawed motivational memes are among the few things that do this to me the most. I decided to make one more attempt on exploring why I feel that way. This time, instead of being sarcastic, I will try to be direct. Instead of outrage, I will try to appeal. \"What is your long-term goal?\" is the most popular question that floats around final year batches of any undergraduate college in India. Followed in popularity by something like \"next enna pannalamnu irrukinga?\" (what next?). People have to decide between a random exam for a post graduate course, or hope that they would get \"placed\" in one of the many companies that conduct campus recruitments. Apparently, our under-graduate education is not good enough to get us jobs. My college hired an external company to orient us to the requirements of the corporates who would be looking to hire us. It was called pre-placement training : a two day program that was supposed to make us battle-ready. I attended because there was a rumour floating around that the pre-placement training was mandatory for those who wanted to make themselves available for the campus recruitments. I would have attended otherwise too, for I was eager to get placed. \"Have you noticed a dog that comes in the way of a speeding vehicle?\", asked the guy who was leading the team of pre-placement trainers. \"It panics. It reacts without thought. And more often than not, it gets hit. Look at a buffalo though, and how it rarely panics. You must all be like the buffalo, and not panic in stressful situations\". The whole training focussed on \"lessening our inhibitions\". When someone questioned the rationale behind the whole event, the trainers explained about a \"cockroach\" theory. Someone who fears a cockroach would let go of the fear if the only other option he/she had was to face something more scary, like a snake. These guys were attempting to put us in situations where we would permanently loose all our inhibitions, be our true selves, and hence, blaze through all interviews. On the final day of this training, I spotted a couple of ferocious looking buffaloes running towards me with great speed at Thanjavur New Bus Stand. Recalling our training, I controlled my panic and stepped aside casually, only to notice that the buffaloes were actually running away having been scared by a tiny dog. That's when I realized that motivating people is a big money making industry today, and that the dog and the buffalo story is exactly what is wrong with this industry. This industry aims to transform us all into buffaloes, and it makes us feel grateful for this transformation -- until the day we get hit by a speeding vehicle and realize that our skin is not made to withstand. The modern employable candidate has great communication skills, is filled with positive thoughts, has leadership qualities, believes everything is possible, dresses carefully and is capable of motivating others.\u0026nbsp; I am a sceptic by nature. Apart from being not-sure of most things, I really get baffled when others are sure of things. This bafflement usually transforms into a mild envy at an ability that I do not have. But, when these same people are so sure of their views that they try imposing it on others, I get irritated. Priests call us sinners for not believing in God, and Richard Dawkins calls us fools for believing in Him. Why do we get an overpowering urge to get others to conform to our views? How do people decide that buffaloes are better than dogs, or that dogs are better than buffaloes?\u0026nbsp; All groups of people hate non-conformists. Have you noticed that some people take an irrational pleasure in killing your individuality? \"Why are you not like others\", \"we all do it, why don't you\", and \"you are right, but no one does it that way\". Even as kids, we bully other kids who are different. And we grow up to measure the success of other people based on our own definition of it. There is probably one correct way to live life, one purpose to it. Socrates thought it to be intellectual pursuit, Epicurus thought it to be non-materialistic happiness, Schopenhauer thought it to be suffering, Nietzsche thought it to be power, Sartre thought it to be void and Camus thought it to be whatever. When minds of such intellectual caliber try and fail \u0026nbsp;to achieve a common ground, an agreement; where do we with our intellectual and moral handicaps get the confidence that our definition of success is right? There is always one prevailing way societies judge success. A few years back it was external virtuousness. Today, it is material wealth. Most motivational quotes subtly hint that material wealth is a big part of success. It is important that they do it subtly, for we are not yet ready to accept the importance of money outright. Take a Robin Sharma's motivational seminar, for example. He starts with a meaningless disclaimer (I would know a lot about meaningless disclaimers), explaining that success need not be a high paying job. But the rest of the speech contains veiled references to rich people in high places : \"I asked this Vice President\", \"I was talking to a CEO of a Fortune 500 company\" and so on an on. He casually refers to his audio CDs, online course and seminars, all of which cost a lot of money. The unspoken understanding is that the money you spend is just an investment which will provide high returns later on. Invest on your personality. And why are we so wrapped up in changing our personality. Apparently, schools these days are doing away with the traditional benches and are replacing them with round tables which facilitate more interaction. Children are discouraged from spending time alone with their own imaginations. We are already a generation that feels too entitled. We complain about the quality of food in flights, and the signal strength in free Wi-Fi zones. We are quick to point out how the other person is inefficient in his work, but we forget that we are mediocre in our own jobs. We believe everything is possible, and that we can win every battles. We are turning into an army of sore losers. We are all trying to be something we are not, in a hope that it will allow us to be our own selves. Each of us wants to look polished, to express lucidly, and to dress up meticulously. If some people have it their way, we would soon loose all traits that make us us, and end up as someone else. You probably think I am paranoid. I will tell you who else was paranoid. Check out the embedded 3 and a half minute video of George Carlin's brilliant\u0026nbsp;I Am A Modern Man, and you will realize that he was eerily accurate. \"My inner child is outward bound\", \"I'm a non-believer and an over-achiever\" and \"in denial\". Read the full text here\u0026nbsp;if you are not able to view the video. Like in my previous post, here is another open letter: Dear Mr/Mrs.Whoever-wants-other-people-to-adopt-your-ideas-of-success, I know all your arguments on why life must be lived your way, and honestly, they sound very convincing. Yet, I don't feel like joining you. I would rather define success my own way, even at the risk of being wrong. I don't mean this in an individualistic I-dont-give-a-damn-about-your-views way. I respect your point of view, but I do not think it will fit me. Be with me, but let me be.

I overcame that moment, and I am really glad that I did. Lakshminarayanan was one of the last persons I asked to write for me. Lakshmi has written almost nothing at all in public forums, and I was extremely curious to see him try. I didn't expect him to write though, and he didn't make me feel too confident that he would write. \u0026nbsp;By happenstance, the Bangalore Special Court intervened, and pronounced a judgement that provoked an immediate reaction from Lakshmi. \u0026nbsp; Lakshmi was me with me in college. He is a very good friend outside this blog. He is one of the few people who one can address as sutha thangam (pure gold) without being too far off the mark. Often grumpy, he has a lot of strong views on various things happening around him, and does not care too much for tact while voicing them. He has read only a few posts in the blog to my knowledge. One of these posts --\u0026nbsp;A Comprehensive (but clumsy) Career Flowchart\u0026nbsp;--\u0026nbsp;was\u0026nbsp;conceived after a conversation I had with him where he achieved the impossible : make me feel more pessimistic than I already am. As it will be very obvious after reading this post, he is a staunch supporter of Jayalalitha. My own views on her conviction is not completely formed yet. Jayalalitha is (was?) definitely a whimsy, but capable administrator. The whole situation makes me wonder if the right thing and the good thing are always the same. That she be arrested is the right thing. However, is it for the larger good? Probably so in the longer run, but I still wonder. It is definitely not a great thing for the Tamil Nadu's short term future. The Vulnerable Queen When Adarsh asked me to write about something, I was very much reluctant for obvious reasons. But there are times when you feel like writing and this is one such occasion . This is just an outpour of what my mind feels right at this moment . I never thought that I would write an article on J.Jayalalitha . A person whom many consider as arrogant , stubborn and a dominant personality . I haven't got an opportunity to interact with her( Yeah that's obvious:P) , \u0026nbsp;but I have been observing her as a podhu janam(a common man) . This article is purely based on my observation and views. Hope I have the right as a citizen of the country to air my views. Jayalalitha is someone who has been criticized for everything. Yes, everything she does has been criticized. If she stands in the portico and waves her hand at the people, she is termed imperious. \u0026nbsp;If she doesn't answer questions to reporters then she is termed arrogant. Phew actually the list goes endless. \u0026nbsp;But how can a person still move on? If it were me, I would have given up. It is also said that she files defamation cases on people spreading aspersions on her. Let’s say some one unknown to us says the wildest and most ridiculous things about us , what would we do? If I were in that situation, I would go straight to that person and ask on what grounds that he /she spoke such things. Can she do that? It's not possible at all, and the best way to deal with such things would be filing defamation cases. For extremely sensitive people it's really difficult to tolerate such things! I know this, since I am hypersensitive too. There are lot of things that many (including myself) should learn from this attitude of hers. If we start taking criticism that is made about us, it will be really difficult to move on in life . In the end we have to live for our own self , if we start paying heed to unwanted criticisms I am sure life would become hell, because we can never satisfy everybody. Today someone would say that this is wrong and tomorrow another person would say that you have to totally change your approach. This can never work out at all . The kind of slandering that she has faced in the media is totally disturbing, I am sure that no other person would have faced so much. Yet how was she able to become the CM not just once but thrice? Many of my friends would now say that it was because of the mis-governance of the previous regimes. Yes that's agreed, but is that the only reason? Definitely not. Who had the courage to vanquish the forest brigand Veerapan? When the state was suffering from a high rate of female infanticide , who introduced \u0026nbsp;the cradle baby scheme? Implementation of Compulsory Rain water harvesting in buildings\u0026nbsp;-- whose idea was that ? If I start pointing out facts, then I am sure Adarsh would screw me for ruining his page , so let me get back to her character analysis. The decision making skill, the ability to grasp and act accordingly is a vital ingredient which she has and many others lack. People say she intimidates men - Okay history is known , she has been and has to be stern to in order to sustain her position in the party . I am not sure as to how else can a person be able to accomplish his/her supremacy in the party. If she was quite timid and gullible in nature then I am sure that someone would have easily eaten up her . She is a person who is extremely forthright and at the same time vulnerable. At this crucial juncture , \u0026nbsp;I \u0026nbsp;wish\u0026nbsp; that she be acquitted in this case, because it's really difficult to find a person with the charisma of hers. \u0026nbsp;Also it is strenuous to find a person with great administrative skill, oratory capabilities and multi-linguistic fluency. This is a very rare combination (one must be gifted to have all of them, I would say). I am sure that many people might ridicule me for this article, but I am not bothered about that at all . The state needs a person who is fearless and humane and I am sure that currently there is no-one to replace her. Many people tried to wish her away from politics twice , I wish that their third attempt in trying to wither her off from the political stage of TN be an utter failure . Thanks Adarsh for giving me an opportunity to scribble something ! Hope that I made some sense :) Regards, Lakshminarayanan (LVN) ","date":"30 September 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/guest-post-series---the-vulnerable-queen/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Guest Post Series - The Vulnerable Queen","type":"posts"},{"content":" Hidden amongst all the bleak, dreary, depressing and pessimistic thoughts in my blog, there lies a promise I once made -- that I will explain the immensely significant impact of motivational quotes on me. Promises are meant to be kept. I have been receiving millions of motivational messages on WhatsApp, Facebook and increasingly rare face-to-face conversations. Since I am yet to give up the belief that my blog would be seen by history as a one of the most creative human achievements ever, I decided to share a few of these \"must-read\" messages as a part of a \"Success Series\". Future students who read this blog as a part of this school syllabus may take note of the important messages, and live their lives accordingly. I would also leave a short write-up of my own thoughts on, and my interpretations of the messages at the end. Here is a message I got recently. Reproduced as it is, except for the bolding of the title [Fist Punch smiley] Must Read.....\nThe Samosa Vendor\n“Today in India its unbelievable ....... The numbers are a little difficult to swallow, ...... But interesting nevertheless.” It was my regular train journey home from work. I boarded the 18:50pm train from churcugate. When the train was about to leave marinelines, a samosa vendor with an empty basket got on and took the seat next to me. As the compartment was sparsely occupied and my destination was still far away,\u0026nbsp;I got into a conversation with him. Me: \"Seems like you've sold all your samosas today.\" Vendor (smiling): \"Yes. By God's grace, full sales today.\" Me: \"I really feel sorry for you people. Don't you get tired doing this tiresome job the whole day?\" Vendor: \"What to do, sir? Only by selling samosas like this every day do. We get a commission of 75 paise for each samosa that we sell.\" Me: \"Oh, is that so ? How many samosas do you sell on an average each day?\" Vendor: \"On peak days, we sell 4,000 to 5,000 samosas per day. On an average, we sell about 3,000 samosas a day.\" I was speechless.....for a few seconds. The guy says he sells 3,000 samosas a day; at 75 paise each, he makes about 2,000 rupees daily, or 60,000 rupees a month. That's Rs. 60,000 a month. OMG.\u0026nbsp;I intensified my questioning and this time it was not for time pass. Me: \"Do you make the samosas yourself?\" Vendor: \"No Sir. we gets the samosas through a samosa manufacturer And we just sell them. After selling we give him the money. And gives us 75 paise for each samosa that we sell.\" I was unable to speak a single word more but the vendor continued...\u0026nbsp; \"But one thing...most of our earnings are spent on living expenses. Only with the remaining money are we able to take care of other business.\" Me: \"Other business? What is that?\" Vendor: \"It is a land business. In 2007 I bought 1.5 acres in Palghar for 10 lakh rupees and I sold it a few months back for 60 lakhs. Now I have bought land in umroli for 20 lakh rupees.\" Me: \"What did you do with the remaining amount? Vendor: \"Of the remaining amount, I have set aside 20 lakhs for my daughter's wedding. I have deposited the other 20 lakhs in the bank.\" Me: \"How much schooling have you had?\" Vendor: \"I studied up to third standard; I stopped my studies when I was in the 4th standard. But I know how to read and write. Sir, there are many people like yourself, who dress well, wear a tie, wear shoes, speak English fluently and work in air-conditioned rooms. But I don't think you guys earn as much as we do wearing dirty clothes and selling samosas.\" At this point, what could I reply. After all, I was talking to a millionaire! The train chugged into khar station and the samosa vendor got up from his seat. Vendor: \"Sir, this is my station...have a good day.\" Me: \"Take care.\" What more is there to say... \"Never underestimate the Power of the Common Man\". Dear Mr.Whoever-has-all-the-time-in-this-World-to-type-out-that-crap-content,\n\"What more is there to say\" absolutely sums it up. Your splendid story spreads a very useful message -- that one must not judge others too soon. Your story discourages arrogance, and encourages us to get to know others; who might impart to us some valuable success lessons. \u0026nbsp;Even if we momentarily put aside the moral core of your message, your story is an artistic achievement. It had me engrossed and entertained. The twist in the end was totally unexpected. The character development is admirable; the character arc of the narrator in your autobiographical story changes gradually but firmly from being a moron who judges people by their appearances to a moron who judges people by their wealth. This is exactly the message I want children to hear, so that they will grow into better individuals. Thanks for sharing your enthralling experience. I encourage you to keep spreading goodwill.

We believe\u0026nbsp;that all \"babus\" are lazy and corrupt, and all others are hardworking. The way we talk about about the public servants in our everyday conversations, it would seem as if we outsiders are efficient, upright, hardworking and disciplined chaps who lift up the country on our over-burdened shoulders, whilst the politicians and public servants do their utmost to bring it down. I have always wanted to write a lengthy post on this despicable tendency we have to generalize, but I have always held back because of an apprehension that my anger would seep through. When you argue with anger, you risk losing objectivity; and even if you don't, it is difficult to convince others that you haven't. I know Shyam since school. We were not close. Our conversations were on Sidney Sheldon and James Hadley Chase; Anniyan and Rang De Basanti. He would lend me his excellent\u0026nbsp;Haliday-Resnick-Walker\u0026nbsp;Physics book on my request, and I would return it untouched (along with the ₹50 notes he stuffs into his books and forgets). He became closer later on, when we both started blogging around the same time. We happened to meet randomly at movie festivals and bookshops, and through all these we have had some great discussions on a variety of things. He introduced me to and lent to me a book very close to my heart -- Of Human Bondage by Somerset Maugham. I have admired the variety in his blog : he writes poems, prose, reviews, interviews, travelogues and everything else. Read his brilliant series of articles on \"The journey from 'boy' to 'man'\", a write-up on the \"The Way of the Heart\" and a cute poetic adaptation of \"And Then There Were None\". His feedback on my own blog are usually pinpoint - he quotes the lines he likes and politely disagrees when he has to. Shyam is also a part of a short story collection \u0026nbsp;a few of us are attempting to self-publish online. Look forward to a couple of beautiful stories from him. I will introduce the other two writers of this collection too as a part of this series. He is, as far as I know, unsusceptible to the loss of objectivity I rambled about. When we all did the traditional engineering degree and looked for IT jobs, he did a B.Sc, followed it up with an overseas MS, took up a motley of jobs in start-ups and banks, cleared UPSC and is now a\u0026nbsp;bureaucrat. All this put together gives him the impartiality to judge\u0026nbsp;Indian beurocracy. I asked him to give us a glimpse of the much misunderstood inner workings of the Government of India, and here is his memoir of his first year with it. Bureaucrat Bloody Hell \u0026nbsp;“Every Government servant shall at all times maintain absolute integrity” \u0026nbsp;- Rule 3(1)(i), Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964 “You're born, you take shit. You get out in the world, you take more shit. You climb a little higher, you take less shit. Till one day you're up in the rarefied atmosphere and you've forgotten what shit even looks like. Welcome to the layer cake son.” \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;- Eddie Temple in the film ‘Layer Cake’ The first quotation is from the rule book, the second from a crafty gangster movie. Both apply equally to a government servant in India. I’ve been a bureaucrat for a year now. What follows is an account of my first impression of babudom. Read on then, you might at least be amused. Let me be honest about my attitude towards the services. It was an outsider’s urge to act that made me enter the Civil Services. The general apathy of things, the persistent sights of unemployment, disease, inefficiency and helplessness. When asked in the interview why I wanted to join the bureaucracy, I said that I believed it was the best position for a person in my square - a young graduate in India. You get the lot - the chance to serve, remuneration, status. After entering the government factory, the workings of the machinery became more familiar. I looked at it in awe, in disgust and in sobriety. The system was immense, had a voracious appetite, there were rusted parts, there were finer parts. During the first two years, you are trained. You see the river through its course, not swimming in it but surveying it with the eye of someone who is going to spend the rest of his life swimming in it. The young idealistic entrant full of values and noise but not of much use at navigating the system who finally becomes the veteran hawk, all purity traded for life skills that teach him to prey and sacrifice as and when necessary. Like the cold, clear water at the source, supporting little life but pure in its essence he enters. The acquirement of nutrients when flowing down to the valley, the start of life and the increase in fertility of the water body, the vitality of its mid-course as animal, plant and human activity burgeons and eventually the delta, the shallows filling up and the river mingling with the ocean. C’est la vie.\u0026nbsp; I am from the Indian Information Service. As trainees to become the communication ambassadors of the government, we spend many hours in presentations, field visits, debates and brain storming sessions. We analyse the excellence of the Election Commission, the handling 26/11 attacks, why Bharat Ratna Sachin is still selling Luminous inverters and how some men (be it E. Sreedharan or Vinod Rai) develop the uncanny ability to cut across red tape and deliver results. We see the good, bad and ugly. The hope is that this incubation time will acclimatise us to government temperature and hopefully pack our rucksacks with things necessary on the road trip from smart to wise. After a year, the machine has helped show me my place in the scheme of things. It has taught me to understand that at whatever level we strive for whatever goal, let us remember that ‘’Tis but a part that we see, and not a whole’. It is necessary to keep it humble, to keep it human. Bureaucracy has also helped me appreciate life more, embrace it with a bit more affinity. The same day throws at you experiences that are extraordinarily diverse. Just after drenching in the experience of seeing a Livelihood Mission change the lives of women in rural Andhra Pradesh, after witnessing Ratnamma talk with brimming pride on how she took a revolving loan of 5 lakhs from her SHG and repaid it, how she managed to free her husband from bonded labour from that money, you also go into the details of the blunders in the KG Basin deal. It is life in microcosm. And with a worm’s eyeview of that microcosm, the richness overwhelms and propels us\u0026nbsp; towards becoming better, serving better. But let us see what unfolds in the coming years, what surprising turns and twists await. Robert Browning said it so well ‘Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be’. Thanks a ton Adarsh for the opportunity, Yours Cheerfully, Shyam ","date":"27 September 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/guest-post-series---bureaucrat-bloody-hell/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Guest Post Series - Bureaucrat Bloody Hell ","type":"posts"},{"content":" Note : This post is a part of the Guest Post Series.\nIn a pre-release interview for the unmatchably hilarious Tamil movie Naduvulla Konjam Pakkatha Kanom, director Balaji Tharanitharan revealed the reasoning behind one of the most rip-roaring moments of the movie, explaining that the deepest friendships are often formed due to totally insignificant, forgettable incidents. I don't remember when Gowrisankar and I started becoming good friends. We just ended up so sometime during the second year of our college. We would make the short journey from our college to Thanjavur New Bus Stand together, often having bunked the last one or two classes of the day. We would discuss cricket, movies and everything else, often disagreeing with each other, whilst eating some excessively oiled pakodas with watered chutney (chutneyed water?) at the bus stand (₹3 per plate). He would lie around at our house/room until we drove him out. We would travel on his dabba, barely functional TVS excel to his house, stopping by to fill Speed petrol\u0026nbsp;on his insistence; lock his parents in a room and shoot badly made short-films, letting them out only briefly so that they can watch a tele-serial written by Cho Ramaswamy. The thing with Gowri is that he rarely likes to hear that he can't do stuff. With sometimes hilarious dedication he keeps trying myriad things. And he often ends up doing them quite well. I can name a lot of instances where he started at square zero and improved himself immensely. He started writing just to compete with a few of us, and he keeps on. My favourite of his writing is this post titled \"Remembering one of the best days of my life\". I supported all teams other than India during the 2013 World Cup, and I am usually proud of my shameless act. This post was one of those rare moments which made me realise the impact India's victory had on a lot of people, and caused a momentary regret in me for my lack of \"patriotism\".\nAs a reader, he usually reads most of my posts, and finds novel ways to disagree. He is so intent on letting me know what he thinks that he once commented on one of my blog posts with a \"I have nothing to say\". He is also a good cricketer, often ensuring that he becomes the captain of various hurriedly-put-up teams. I asked him to write on the most memorable cricket match he has played, and he recounts one such incident. I must admit that I had no idea of such an incident until I read this. My Most Memorable Cricket Match This is a story of how a bunch of boys became men, how we overcame the odds to beat the best team in college, how we taught the arrogant opposition a lesson of subtility on their own game. Err.. Scratch that. It was a bloody murder. We got mauled by the mechanical department. But still why this ludicrous match is one of my favorite ? Read on. They announced the inter department tournament for 2nd years in SASTRA. The glamorous, prestigious and glittering silver cup, the dream of many and prized possession that the 7 departments were playing for. OK OK sorry. It was a normal dept tournament with 1000 rs for the winning team with 500rs entry fee for every team. Other departments had some college team players in them, we, let's just say we had 11 people in our team. First the organizers thought of scratching our team as they thought we don't have eleven boys in our department! Respective Sir, I accept that biotechnology was a girls dominated dept, but to say that we don't have 11 boys who know the nuances of cricket!! Too much pride at stake. Too much. I had to show them. We registered our dept in tournament.\u0026nbsp; It was match day. I was the department team captain. Here, let me rephrase it. I'm captain of the 2nd year biot team, the whole department ( waiting for it to echo). But 30 mins before the match we had just 3 members of our team in the ground. The opposition players were practising catches while we 3 furiously called our hostel mates to join our team. 20 mins before the match, 4 more joined. That was it, I lost it. I went directly to the hostel rooms, banged their doors hard and apologized immediately for doing that. Then, I asked(pleaded) them to play for biot dept team. They said they are sleepy. But I couldn't let that happen. I told them that there were no players and the team was completely banking on them. (\"Not!\"). 5 minutes before the match, we had 11 heads. Eleven members! Oh yeah!! We lost the toss were put into bat. Here's another reason why this is one of my favorite match, \u0026nbsp;I opened batting and bowling and \u0026nbsp;kept wickets! That's what dreams of every gully cricketers made of. We batted carefully, me and Mr A. He got out when we were 24 at 5th over. Then I had a decent partnership with Mr N and took our team to 55 for 1 when he got out. Then our players switched on Indian test team formula of \" come, getout, repeat \" mode. I made a nonchalantly brilliant 45, but the team was bundled out for 68. People clapped when I walked back to the pavilion. That was a great moment for me. They batted. We (apart from me, of course) bowled like a bunch of 6 year old girls throwing balloons at each other.Particularly we had a bowler( let's say \" almost Akthar\") who ran at 90 miles per hour and bowled at 20miles/hour. It was like his primary purpose is to run hard; bowling the ball -- that was just the byproduct of his super special running. The opposition targeted him particularly and clubbed him for 18 an over, naturally. We lost the match inside 9 overs. All the players from mechanical team said bad luck and that I played very well. They made me feel like,\" if only I had a better team\". But the truth was, we were never really in the game and pummeled for the same. I remember this the most because I scored 45, hitting some of the college team bowlers for boundaries. I proved that biot had more than 10 boys and it was not all girls department. ( I had my doubt too, at one stage one of the pace bowler in my team came and said \"Machi, touch my hair da, see how silky it feels\"!! ). Next day seeing the scorecard many guys asked about me( organizers told me). I got respect from all the players who watched the match that day for the next 2 years in college. It was like dancing for \"rains of castamere\" while my teammates are bruised by the Lannisters. I enjoyed it. Memorable day. - from the captain of 2nd yr biot cricket team SASTRA. P.S. The Bioinformatics department of our college didn't play the tournament because organizers thought they were not even a real department. Ha ha!

My brother often makes me feel old. When he has views, he usually voices them without wondering if he is being polite. He also provides hilarious entertainment to us all at home : sometimes deliberately, but often accidentally. When on a random day he started writing a story, we were all taken aback. This tiny little story was about a scientist who invents an unreliable time machine. Since I didn't admit that I liked it, he had to go online hunting for people who would \"publish\" it. I was astonished when he came back to me with a literary agent from UK who called him over phone to fix a deal. But then, we worked out that this literary agent was a potential fraud looking for some easy money. Recently, when I mentioned to him about my idea of publishing a collection of short stories with a few friends (more on this later), his immediate response was a haughty : \"You want to get introduced to my literary agent\"?.\nHe had more surprise for us in store as he started a blog soon. Though he hasn't written much, I loved how this post called \"A theory that's so catastrophic\" started with craziness and ended with unexpected profundity. Since he is good at dishing out things he doesn't like, I asked him to dish out a movie he hated. He almost didn't get ideas, until he happened to see Anjaan.\nAnjaan - A Review When Lingusamy was interviewed, he promised us Anjaan would not be another disappointment from him as he had put all his efforts and newly learnt direction techniques. So did it work?\u0026nbsp; Hell yeah.. Here's a great film that 5 years kids MIGHT enjoy. This film is all about grown-ups pretending to be grown-ups. Haa! I remember those days when I pretended to be a cop and arrested my friends. I even had some cool Nerf guns to shoot my rowdy friends. Bang bang!! (Still a better bang than Anjaan). That's what happens here. And in Anjaan, it's Surya who pretends to be a don controlling Mumbai. And how does he become so powerful? Well he doesn't. He just pretends. Oops. SPOILER. You might have watched Toy Story, Lego Movie or Little Toy Soldier. But Anjaan is the adult version of such movies. Surya : Dei I bill be polish da. Bleas.\nCommissioner : No No I bil be polish. You be Rajju Bhai.\nSurya : Boy ah? I am already boy only da.\nVidyut : Dei adhu bhai da. Ok then I will be Chandru Boy. Let's start playing da. Mummy gave permission for 2 and a half hours only da.\nLingusamy : Annnnnd action.\nSo it's a don movie and a powerful don is controlling the place. Shouldn't there be someone who betrays his trust and kills the one who's close to the don? It happens. And who's close to Surya? Again you guessed correctly. Vidyut Jamwal, the same person who got shot by Ajith in Billa 2, got punched to death by Thuppaki Vijay, has made it here only to show that strong men do cry. Awww. Such a cry baby. Should not have come here. \u0026nbsp;And who's the villain who pulls the trigger? Apparently Manoj Bajpai needed a break from all those serious roles. \"Time to get crazy Manoj. \u0026nbsp;Just pretend that you are a notorious don, kiddo! Attaboy! Yay it worked\", says director to the villain. \"Time to bust those punks\", says Surya who's back from death. Now Surya goes in disguise to avenge his friend's death and then the distributors and producer lived happily ever after (sort of!). But this film had a deep meaning : it's never too late to be a kid once again. Every scene in this movie was so relatable in my life. There's a scene where Surya and Vidyut goes to a party and a villain says \"I will slaughter you like pigs.\" A very hurt Vidyut keeps repeating the line again and again. After a while he tells to Surya, \"Thukanu da avana. Ni edho panirupiye? Thukitala? Thukitala? (We have to teach that bully a lesson. What? You already did?).\" Surya smiles indicating he did. Similar thing happened to me once. Me and my friend, 7 years ago, went to another dude's house. This dude had a\u0026nbsp;'Snake Eyes' action figure/Bhommai. And this rich dude told my friend, \"where's your G.I.Joe toy da?\". Somewhat hurt by this statement my friend said to me, \"Thukanum da avan Snake eyes ah (We've to steal his toy).\" But unlike Surya I didn't teach that rich kid a lesson. Such a memorable childhood. If not for Anjaan, the memories would have gone to the 'Junk Folder' like the movie file in my system. The movie also shows how valuable friendship is. Because when Surya pretends to be a Don, his friends play along. Such a wonderful friendship. Bottomline: Rajju Bhai has made Viswha bhai a better bhai (Acha Kidar?).\nNote: Don't miss Samantha's cameo.\nPS:\nWilson : Death or worse?\nHouse: \u0026nbsp;Worse !!? Double death?\nLingusamy: Nope Anjaan! Bang Bang Bang!!

Hello! I wanted to begin the guest post series with my father's post, and I had to hold a couple of posts I have already received from my friends. Our house is a messy place. It is so messy that we have an exclusive \"looking-for-lost-things\" time twice every day (once pre-breakfast, and once again post-dinner). On certain days, when what we are looking for is not extremely urgent, we stop to contemplate about our house, and we realize that there are too many books (along with too many every other thing). Not all these books are my appa's, but a lot of them are. He never restricts us from buying more books, and we generously pile on books we have no intention of reading. \u0026nbsp;I believe there are books of all possible genres lying around. I have read only 10% of all these books, and I don't expect to read all of them at all. It is thanks to my father that the habbit of reading was inculcated into me, and it is thanks to him that I started writing. Among all heaps of books scattered around, I have seen a series of books on Journalism. There is no doubt that my father has had ambitions to write, so he didn't need much convincing. I asked him to write something about certain incidents from his childhood, but he was reluctant as they were too personal. When I insisted, he mixed in some fiction, and made it into a short story. Good luck trying to spot which is real and which is fiction. Vagabond The Volvo bus was stuck in a traffic pile up between Jaipur and Delhi for more than half an hour. “This has become a frequent occurrence on this road.\u0026nbsp; Road widening on this stretch is going on for more than six years.\u0026nbsp; Nobody knows when it will be finished”, \u0026nbsp;the young man sitting beside him was telling him in\u0026nbsp; Hindi. Kumar checked his watch. He was doubtful about catching his flight to Chennai.\u0026nbsp; He asked the young man whether Airport Metro Services had been resumed. \u0026nbsp;“I believe it has” was the bored reply he got. The young man’s attention was now turned to his smart phone. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Kumar’s\u0026nbsp; trip to Jaipur had been in connection with an eight year old case in which he had been summoned as a witness. It was only because of his alertness that the forgery was found out and the payment on the cheque was stopped at the last moment. He had been to Jaipur for the fourth time in that year. He had expected it to be over this trip. But there was no hearing as the lawyers were on strike. A long drawn Judicial process was turning into a chase of an elusive mirage. In a country in which the wheels of justice did not even seem to move, lawyers by\u0026nbsp; going on strike put their spokes in that wheel. Perhaps they had more faith in Trade Unionism than their advocacy skills.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; There had been a time when he enjoyed travel by road and the thrills of it. But now it was getting on his nerves evidencing the fact that he was getting old. The luxury of travel by Volvo AC Bus was lost due to the intermittent hold ups of traffic. Kumar pitied those drivers who had to drive in such conditions. He got down from the bus and could see Aravalli range, a\u0026nbsp; broken and irregular line of hills. \u0026nbsp;Ahead of and the behind the Volvo stretched a long line of containers, trucks, and cars. The traffic jam was due to a vehicle struck on the lane due to punctured tyres. Someone was spreading the good news that it had been removed. \u0026nbsp;After ten minutes, slow movement of\u0026nbsp; vehicles ahead could be observed.\u0026nbsp; He got back into the bus and settled into his seat as the bus started moving. The bus \u0026nbsp;had to crawl and fight for space with other vehicles to come out of the diverted lane to merge into the wide highway. He hoped that he would be in Delhi in another 2 hours.\u0026nbsp; But, it took more than two hours. After reaching Gurgaon the bus had to crawl in the maddening City traffic. It was humid and hot when he got down at Daual Kuan and took the foot over bridge to reach the Metro Station. The silence of the Metro Station was a striking contrast to the noise of traffic outside. Unlike the main metro services, these services seemed to be\u0026nbsp;patronized\u0026nbsp;less. \u0026nbsp;The near empty metro\u0026nbsp;train, traversing on the track above the road by which he reached Delhi, gradually descended from over head level to ground level and plunged into the darkness of a tunnel. It was a long walk from the Metro station to the Terminal. When he reached the gate for his flight after completing the formalities, he felt that there was enough time for the boarding.\u0026nbsp; He settled in a chair to watch the news in Television channels. Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir had been hit by the worst ever disaster of the century. Cameras captured Srinagar floating in water, cut off villages, half washed bridges, collapsed houses and the irreplaceable tragedy of those who lost their kith and kin. The revenge of the nature for the stupidity of human tendency to destroy the ecosystem was of horrible proportions. The visuals stirred memories deep buried inside him. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; The boarding for the Indian Airlines flight to Chennai had started. He would be having some rest in the flight. His awful mood after a futile and frustrating day was persisting. As people formed the queue for boarding, he almost lost his temper when the person standing behind him in the queue literally shoved him \u0026nbsp;to draw the attention of the tall handsome person with a prominent nose standing before him. “Ram what a surprise! How are you?”\u0026nbsp; He glared and stepped aside to allow him to join his friend. They started talking animatedly in Tamil. Another Ramesh and Suresh\u0026nbsp;without chocolates in their hands, he thought bitterly.\u0026nbsp; Then he saw the person who was addressed as Ram and remembered that he had seen before him at the ticket counter. He had left his Identity card in the counter and Kumar had to call him back to collect it. From the Yellow ID card he could gather that Ram was a Central \u0026nbsp;Govt. Officer. He looked younger and more handsome than his friend.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The movement in the plane was slow as usual. At row no 23, he observed with vexation that the Govt. Officer who was addressed as Ram was comfortably settled in the seat allotted to Kumar next to his long lost friend. As Kumar stopped to confirm his seat number from the \u0026nbsp;boarding pass, Ram asked\u0026nbsp; him, “will you \u0026nbsp;mind shifting to 23 A?” Kumar was happy to get the window seat and he nodded as if he was really doing a favour to them. \u0026nbsp;He settled into his seat. Tomorrow, by this time, he would be in Trichy.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Beside him, the friends settled and continued their conversation.\u0026nbsp; “Are you from Chennai?” Ram asked him in English.\u0026nbsp;\n“No. I am from Trichy”.\nKumar replied in English hinting in a tone that he did not want to prolong the conversation.\u0026nbsp;He did not have the patience to tell him after a long life like a vagabond he intended to settle down in Trichy. He could not tell him about all the places traversed in his journey of life. Ram turned to his friend and continued the interrupted conversation. “Ishwar, what were you asking? Yeah, I am going on official business. It is a Court case. So you have finally settled in Chennai” “Once I would have shuddered at settling down in Chennai. Now I got used to its madness.”\n“How is Aparna? \u0026nbsp;I heard your son-in-law is having a roaring practice.” “But Aparna is complaining that he hardly has time for her and the child. Is\u0026nbsp; Karthick\u0026nbsp; still in Detroit?\u0026nbsp; It is more than five years since we met in the airport when you were seeing him off.”\u0026nbsp;\n“No, Ishwar. He is in San Francisco. You know Detroit is a sinking city. I came back from San Francisco only last month. I was there for three months. Vanaja is still there”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Kumar was really exasperated. If his son had been in Philadelphia or Chicago, instead of \u0026nbsp;Madurai, he could also boast like them. Considering the situation of the country there was no wonder everyone\u0026nbsp; wanted to escape to \u0026nbsp;some El Dorado. These two would incessantly be talking till the plane\u0026nbsp; landed. No, his \u0026nbsp;irritability should stop. It was unfair of him to grudge the success of others. He had to get some sleep and should not mind this. But it was difficult to ignore the conversation that happened at such close quarters. It seemed they were friends from childhood. Maybe from some village from Thanjavur District. Cauvery river flowed in their Tamil. To have such \u0026nbsp;school-day friends and to meet them in a faraway airport talking about distant foreign countries is another blessing denied to him. How happy he would have been for such pleasant encounters.\u0026nbsp; He had over the years lost contact with his school and even college mates. His father was in a transferable job moving once every two or three years. When he got employment, his job too happened to be one which necessitated frequent movements. A succession of places, faces , events and impressions got super imposed in his memory obliterating those of earlier years. In his position of carpet beggary and with his reserved attitude, it took considerable time for him to break into an\u0026nbsp; entrenched group of students and by the time he struck some friendship, his father got transferred to some other place.\u0026nbsp; Suseela had on many occasions chances of meeting her school or college friends in train journeys. “You are sullen and reserved. That is why you do not have friends”, she used to comment mockingly quite unappreciative of the fact that her entire schooling and college studies happened in a single place. He had been like a wanderer hopping from place to place. There was a probability that somebody he met somewhere in his school or college days might be in this very Plane. It could be even Ram. But when he replied to Ram curtly he closed the opportunity of even knowing that. His assumption that Ram and his friend were from Thanjavur District might be wrong. He was too tired for even petty conversations. Explaining that he was traveling as a CBI witness would require him to offer more\u0026nbsp;explanations, as if he was a criminal. It is a system where criminals enjoyed more\u0026nbsp;rights and powers than witnesses. He was feeling like a brooding character in an old Russian novel. Was he slipping into insanity? The catering van and the cargo carts moved off and the plane was ready for take off. He\u0026nbsp;dialed\u0026nbsp;Suseela to\u0026nbsp;tell her that he had boarded the plane. Outside, a haze of dust hung over the big runway. The plane started moving slowly, turned, and stopped, waiting for further instructions from air traffic controller. A big jet approached from the east, landed and thundered past the waiting plane. Now the plane moved again, turned slowly, gained speed and roared off into the sky. He shut his eyes. When he opened thrm, spread under him were the luminous lights of Gurgaon and the lights of hundreds of vehicles flowing into and out of Delhi. The flight was gaining height and speed. Kumar tried to recall his friends of school days. But it had been nearly forty years and he rarely revisited the places of his school days. Once he had been to Bhavani, a town near Erode,\u0026nbsp;but it was a very short visit to the Sangameswara Temple. He had stood at Mukkudal to watch with sadness the lean strip of Cauvery and the barren Bhavani. That was before his marriage with Suseela. Friendship could be renewed only \u0026nbsp;by being in constant touch. Of late he had started pruning his acquaintances and kept minimum relationships. In a way, he had become a recluse by choice and he had no regrets about it. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Strangely, today he had been recalling his Bhavani School days as he was watching the visual images\u0026nbsp; of floods in Kashmir in Television channels. Long buried memories of an unprecedented flood in Bhavani which wrought havoc on the town sprang back. Amidst the memories of the loss of the limited household goods of his impoverished family, there lingered the happy memory of curtailed school hours which was an outcome of that devastating floods which washed away two blocks of school.\u0026nbsp;There was a let up of the incessant chattering of his neighbours when meals were served.\u0026nbsp; After the meals, he gradually drifted into sleep. From a height of \u0026nbsp;thirty six thousand feet \u0026nbsp;he plunged into the depths of a dream.\u0026nbsp; He along with his School friend Ravindran was standing in\u0026nbsp; Mukkudal, where Bhavani, a\u0026nbsp; rain fed river merged into the perennial river Cauvery. Usually Cauvery was \u0026nbsp;in full flow and the Bhavani a lean\u0026nbsp; strip of water.\u0026nbsp; But, \u0026nbsp;on this day Bhavani was in spate overflowing the banks meeting the waters of the Cauvery with an unknown ferociousness and rising palm tree high. It was a terrific sight inspiring awe and dread. All the people from the town were there watching it spell bound. In the crowd, he had lost Ravindran. He shouted for \u0026nbsp;him but could not find him. Now he was hungry and turned \u0026nbsp;to go to home. But he had lost \u0026nbsp;his way and suddenly found himself in the Jaipuir CBI Court.\u0026nbsp; A lanky lawyer showing his back to him was arguing the matter. “Your Honour, in spite of\u0026nbsp; repeated\u0026nbsp; summons, the witness is not appearing before the Court to depose. He should therefore be punished for Contempt of Court”.\nAs the\u0026nbsp; lawyer turned he\u0026nbsp;recognized\u0026nbsp;that it was Ram, his next seat passenger in the plane. The \u0026nbsp;stern and forlorn looking Judge ordered for Kumar’s\u0026nbsp; arrest. \u0026nbsp;Four tall Police Constables, towering over him by a head’s height, came to arrest him.\u0026nbsp; He wanted to shout “this is really unjust.\u0026nbsp; I am only a witness.\u0026nbsp; It was only due to my alertness..........”\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;But the words were caught in his throat. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He had started running\u0026nbsp; but \u0026nbsp;he could not find his way \u0026nbsp;and \u0026nbsp;strangely found himself \u0026nbsp;in \u0026nbsp;IX C class room. Ponnusamy Sir was taking Maths class while a roar of water was heard outside. A School peon came to inform that the classes were to be closed. But Ponnusamy Sir who always had been very strict about attendance shouted at him. As he was shouting the class room was being flooded. Ponnusamy Sir had to relent and order the students to rush out. Students rushed out of the class. Now they were \u0026nbsp;surrounded by water and Kumar found himself alone. Somebody pushed him into the water. As he was carried by the \u0026nbsp;rushing water, no one was there to rescue him and \u0026nbsp;he was swept away in the floods. He could not help \u0026nbsp;swallowing water. He was feeling an unbearable pain and weight in his lungs and was unable to breathe. He was drowning. In the rushing water over his head he could hear the quiz master’s question. “On which National Highway is Bhavani Town situated?” Mocking voice of a girl - \u0026nbsp;“Rama, \u0026nbsp;you do not know the answer for this simple question”. Here he was drowning and dying but nobody cared. He made efforts to shout but nobody heard or saw him. At a distance, somebody was shouting. Suddenly pain shot from his head as somebody violently pulled him up by holding his hair. \u0026nbsp;A long silence followed which was shattered by the words. “It was the year of the great flood”. Kumar woke up startled and was breathing with difficulty. It was Ram who had been speaking. He was in the Plane from Delhi to Chennai.\u0026nbsp; He had been thinking \u0026nbsp;about his days in Bhavani \u0026nbsp;before he went into sleep and had a dream. He had a sudden urge to use \u0026nbsp;the restroom.\u0026nbsp; He got up and went to the rest room. As he washed his age worn face, he was still confused about the dream. The words\u0026nbsp; of Ram was not a part of the dream and their discussion was about a great flood.\u0026nbsp; It was because of his fevered imagination triggered due to the repeated\u0026nbsp; visuals of flood\u0026nbsp; devastation in Jammu and Kashmir. \u0026nbsp;In the dream, the events of real life merged into his fears and apprehensions he was undergoing on that day. On the day of the flood, he had been watching the fury of the flood with Ravindran. But his near drowning was not on the day of the flood. That was one month before the floods. Now he tried to remember the mocking voice of the girl. Then he recalled some long forgotten events during his school days with distinct clarity. They had been staying in the first floor of the house as tenants. The ground floor was occupied by the house owner. The daughter of the house owner had tried to draw him out of his shell many times. She ultimately succeeded in drawing to a conversation two days after the day of the quiz competition. He had been returning from the school and she stopped him before the entrance of the house. She was congratulating him on his winning the first prize when \u0026nbsp;Ramakrishnan crossed them in his bicycle. He stopped his bicycle and started coming to them. Kumar could feel the antagonism in his eyes. She did not speak to him but her eyes were mocking Ramakrishnan. He \u0026nbsp;stopped for a few seconds and glared at them for few seconds without saying anything. Then he got back into his bicycle and sped away. At that time Kumar did not know Ramakrishnan was related to that girl. \u0026nbsp; One week after that event, Kumar along with his parents went to the house of Ramakrishnan. They had been there to thank Ramakrishnan who rescued a drowning Kumar. It was a huge house \u0026nbsp;having a big Central Hall with four rooms on the four corners. His father was in conversation with Ramakrishnan’s father. His mother could easily chat with Ramakrishan’s mother as if they had known each other for a long time. He was \u0026nbsp;standing in a corner with Ramakrishnan;\u0026nbsp;lost for words\u0026nbsp;and awkwardly shaking hands with him. “He is very shy”, his mother was telling Ramakrishan’s mother who was busy giving coffee to the guests. \u0026nbsp;Ramakrishnan, who\u0026nbsp; had saved him from death and could have been a friend, but never really became a friend - a\u0026nbsp; face erased from his memory by time and distance. If he met Ramakrishnan now, it was doubtful whether he could recognise him. \u0026nbsp;How ungrateful he had been. He returned to his seat. The conversation was still continuing. He closed his eyes and started reminiscing \u0026nbsp;about the flood. It was rumoured that the flood was due to a breach of canal brimming with rain waters. The breach was caused\u0026nbsp; by villagers\u0026nbsp;upstream\u0026nbsp;Bhavani who feared that their village would be\u0026nbsp;inundated\u0026nbsp; The town was cut off for two days. When the waters receded taking away two blocks of the school, sediments of the flood were left with an awful smell in every article in the house. Along with stories to be told and retold of\u0026nbsp; the great flood.\u0026nbsp; One of the haunting memories was the washing away of a house. They had been watching from the first floor of his house the increasing levels of water. \u0026nbsp;The newly constructed unoccupied \u0026nbsp;house was obstructing the full\u0026nbsp; flow of Bhavani which had entered the town and was draining through various channels \u0026nbsp;into Cauvery. The force of the water splintered the house into two. One part of it fell and after a lag of few seconds another part fell and was washed away.\u0026nbsp; His recollections were sharply intruded\u0026nbsp; by the conversation between Ishwar and Ram. “We have decided to sell the house. His business had\u0026nbsp; run into losses. You know, they have their own ideas of business and do not change. I had to convince him to \u0026nbsp;come \u0026nbsp;and settle at\u0026nbsp; Chennai. That is why I had to come to Delhi -- for getting the consent of my uncle for the sale of the house”. “It is really a big house. I remember during your sister’s marriage, the house could accommodate the entire marriage crowd. \u0026nbsp;Oh! How I wish to visit Bhavani once.\u0026nbsp; Maybe this November when the Cauvery is \u0026nbsp;in full flow, I should make a visit. In that great flood of \u0026nbsp;our school days, your house accommodated many of the people from inundated houses.” Kumar was startled on hearing this. They were talking about Bhavani. Or was it the dream that was continuing? It is inconceivable on a flight\u0026nbsp; miles away and \u0026nbsp;after nearly forty two years three people were dreaming about the same event. \u0026nbsp;Either he was in their dream or they were in his dream. Or \u0026nbsp;else they were also in a film directed by Shankar based on Film Inception. But it seemed too real to be a dream. Why, this Ram could be Ramakrishnan! And he was saying that \u0026nbsp;Vanaja was in USA.\u0026nbsp; Now he remembered the name of the girl with mocking eyes\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; it was Vanaja.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; “But Ram your house was bigger. What a time we had there! I still remember the hide and seek games we played in that house. Oh that big Central hall! Pity your father had to sell it long back. Last time when I saw the house, demolition work had started. Yes, we will visit Bhavani and see all those places where we played and fought. \u0026nbsp;At one time you were a hero of the town when you rescued one boy from drowning. How you were feted and treated for that heroism. This was in spite of your disliking for\u0026nbsp; that boy because he got the first prize in the School quiz contest. A very sullen and shy boy who had few friends.\u0026nbsp; He just vanished away. \" “Ishwar, I was never a hero. \u0026nbsp;With a detached sense of seeing things from a distance \u0026nbsp;I realize how childish I had been in many of my actions. My reaction on loss of first prize was churlish. But there were times, I was afraid I would lose something more. .........” Ram, Rama, Ramakrishnan. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was sure that this was the same Ramakrishnan -\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;his saviour. \u0026nbsp;There was\u0026nbsp; an untold part of the story of that day which was known only to two people.\u0026nbsp; He was feeling a breathlessness as he visualized that day of his near drowning. The drama of that day played once again in his mind. He was watching the silent flow of Cauvery from the bottom most step of the banks. There was no one else. Suddenly he heard steps behind him. Before he could turn somebody pushed him into the water. As he fell and struggled into the water he thought he saw a lanky handsome boy with a prominent nose standing on the steps of the desolate bank. The initial exultation in Ramakrishan’s eyes now gave way to\u0026nbsp; a panic as the implication of his act \u0026nbsp;dawned on him.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It was forty two years since that day and on that big Central Hall. Other than “Thank you”, Kumar had not found any words to utter. He and Ramakrishnan \u0026nbsp;had been standing there apprising each other like two adversaries in an arena.\u0026nbsp; Kumar couldn't imagine why the loss of the first prize could mean so much. Now, on a plane from Delhi to Chennai the answer to a question which was elusive to him for all these years became apparent to him. It was not the prize. How blind he had been. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; And\u0026nbsp; it did not matter. So much water had \u0026nbsp;flowed down the Cauvery since.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The plane was\u0026nbsp; slowly descending.\u0026nbsp; There was \u0026nbsp;an announcement about the landing at Chennai in a few minutes. \u0026nbsp;He saw below the lights of Chennai emerging slowly out of the infinite darkness of the sea and night.\u0026nbsp; “I do not even remember his full name. It is some Kumar.....”\u0026nbsp; Ram was muttering. “Ram, I think it is Krishna Kumar. \u0026nbsp;No.\u0026nbsp; But \u0026nbsp;it started with a K” “Kesava Kumar”.\u0026nbsp;\nShocked \u0026nbsp;childhood friends turned to face the silent passenger at seat No. 23 A offering his hands to Ramakrishnan. Lights started dimming and the landing begun.

I just realized that it is close to five years since I started blogging. For someone who has been at it for five years, I am remarkably inconsistent as a writer. In my very first post\u0026nbsp;I set myself an agenda that I didn't expect to follow. I am quite surprised to find that I have kept up to that agenda in a few ways. Like Ajinkya Rahane\u0026nbsp;(minus his talent) in his one day international career till date, I haven't managed to become half as good as I can be. I still fish for balls that I shouldn't be playing, I still get myself into knots, I still flounder good starts, and I still distract people into thinking of \"what-could-be\" instead of \"what-is\".\u0026nbsp; Writing has been extremely difficult. Every time I publish a post, I get a bout of anxiety. I wait for feedbacks, and I rarely get as many as I would like. Almost every night I publish a post, my sleep is disturbed, at least once, whilst I wake up at ungodly hours to check if anyone has anything to say about my writing. No one has. Almost always. Strangely, the more the positive mismatch between my expected response to a post and the real feedback I get, the more vigorously I end up writing.\u0026nbsp; Some thanks in order I was wondering why I still persist. Among many reasons, one of the most important is the handful of readers I have. At any point of time, an average post by me gets only a couple of responses. Often, these responses are very unexpected. I write a post, wait with bated breath, sigh, and totally give up. And then I find someone who liked parts of it. A lot of wonderful people have come across these blog (for some indiscernible reason, they rarely come together for the same post). They don't always stick on, but at various moments, they have encouraged me immensely to write. I hesitate to admit this - a quick message or a comment helps a lot. And I am increasingly finding that clicking a link to read random ramblings is tough for people. We live in such an age where time is scarce. You have still managed to spend some time here. Thanks :) OK. But what the heck is this all about? On a day of crazy ideas, I imagined asking a few people to write for my blog. As I kept giving more thought to it, it became crazier. But thankfully, it did not sound impossible. A few days of getting in touch with a lot of people, and I am now pretty confident that I could pull it off. I really hope that I will be able to. Why am I doing this? Short answer - publicity stunt. There are a few supplementary answers too. Firstly, I feel sincerely thankful to all of you. There are times when I have wondered if all my writings are my own delusions, and if they are totally invisible to all other human beings. You have shown me that they are not. Secondly, I want you to experience writing. Many of you already write, in which case I want to introduce others to you. There are a few of you who haven't written anything that is in the public domain. I want to urge you to. Why should I be alone in parading all my insecurities and inconsistencies? Moreover, I also want to test out my theory that the link I have chosen for my blog has been cursed by black magic. If your wonderful writing still fails to draw any semblance of attention to this accursed location, I will be filing a case with the cyber police. Additionally, I wanted Posterity to know that you have been here. Like one of those shameful childhood photos that capture you in some location of time scale and end up in an entirely different time scale to embarass you, I will file this safely. Its main purpose will be to ward of my own anxieties. Finally, when I thank you sincerely for reading this blog, I expect you to feel guilty in the future when you skip certain posts. Through that guilt, I expect to chain you to this boring and hopeless place. I am hoping to trap you into a vicious circle. Why should you be interested to read all this? As readers, you get to see some variety at the blog. For a change, you will encounter some decent writing. If you care about me, you might even meet some of the people who have shaped me. Many of my readers, and friends, have perspectives that are very different from mine. Some of them might even have some positive, motivational, useful things to say. I am extremely excited about a few people who are about to write, and I hope you will be able to discover why. So, who are all writing? Some of the people I have asked to write are very important in my life outside this blog too. A few others are not as close, but they have been very important to this blog. A few have forgotten the existence of this blog, and few might not even know that it exists. I am still thinking about people I could get in touch with, and the list keeps on expanding. Let's wait and watch. This could be a dud; a failed project. Or this could be a mega project that brings back peace to a World that is in dire need of it. Like most things with me, I expect it to be somewhere in the vast middle. Any final words? Since I happen to be conceited, selfish and self-centered, I won't be really quiet during the posts. I will be behaving like an over enthusiastic Master of Ceremonies, introducing everyone who is writing. I have tried to get in touch with a lot of people, but my memory is fallible. If you happen to be reading this and I haven't got in touch with you, please free to remind me. You can always kick my backside for the oversight when we meet next time. If I have already got in touch with you, I request you to humour me, and write.

As Unni told me once, “In this world, you cannot escape happiness”' The Illicit Happiness of Other People is Manu Joseph's second novel, published in early 2013. Set in late 1980s Madras, it is a darkly humorous tragi-comedy about a dysfunctional Malayali family. Manu Jospeh's Madras is a bleak place where \"Men are managers, mothers are housewives. All bras are white. Anglo-Indian girls who walk in floral frocks are Maria\". It \"is (also) full of clone actors, full of acts and moments that people have plagiarized from films\". It is this conservative city where all students aim to get into IITs, and any deviation from normalcy is sneered at with unspoken words that serves as a background for the Manu Jospeh's tale where hidden quirkiness in people break out of their suppression with doubled energy. Oesep Chacko is the father in the Chacko family. An alcoholic, once-famous novelist whose rising fame is stopped by his ambition and the politics of a corrupt country, Oesep Chacko waddles in self-pity and gives up all intentions to provide for his family. Uncharacteristically for a journalist, he \"is a man who wants to be inconspicuous, who suffers when eyes are on him. But then the fate of shy people is that all their fears come true\". \u0026nbsp;Like Mermeladov from Crime and Punishment, his awareness of his uselessness (and harmfulness?) to his family does not urge him to do anything about it. \"Don’t hate me son. There are people in this world who set out to make an omellete but end up with scrambled eggs. I am just one of them\", he explains. Three years after giving up on seeking a meaning to explain his son's inexplicable death, a package addressed to him wakes him up, partially, from his slumber. The Illicit Happiness of Other People is at its core an investigative novel, with a journalist seeking reasons for his son's death. But does his investigation have an answer? After all, \"that a mystery must have a resolution is obviously not a requirement of nature. It is, in fact, another deceit of writers. A plot device, like the idea of a beginning, a middle and an end.\"\u0026nbsp; Mariamma Chacko is his wife, who secretly hopes that she wakes up one day to find her husband dead. She imagines plots to murder him without violence, not too hopeful of them because \"he is made of red earth and Malabar air\". She puts behind adolescent horrors to become fairly successful with a Ph.D in Economics, only to get married to Chacko and to end up as a house-wife struggling to make ends meet. One of her sons describes her as \"very smart, but a bit nutty\". \u0026nbsp;The sole bright spot in her life, Unni Chacko, is plucked away from her, leaving her careless to the needs of her second son -- Thomas. The tragedies of fate are too much for her, but she fights on, despite being a schizoprenic lunatic who talks to walls. \"All my Gold bangles, they have become your shit, haven’t they?\", she asks her younger son.\u0026nbsp; Thomas Chacko is the one character who really deserves our pity. Thoma is a Mayflower, in his own words, \"I was this little boy whom nobody noticed. I was invisible.\" \u0026nbsp;A loser by the standards of the normal World, Thomas is eternally over-shadowed by his more charismatic brother, even after his brother's death. \"Unni had no Expectations from Life. So Unni had no reasons to be afraid. Thoma wants so many things from the world, from people. That is why he is afraid, and that is why he is petty\". \u0026nbsp;With both his parents immersed in their own tragedies, Thomas has no one to turn to. Introverted, awkward, mediocore in everything he does, each day is a struggle for Thoma. There is an hilarious sequence where Thomas tries to impress a girl with the only two facts he has ever managed to learn (What does KGB stands for? What is Pele's real name?). In another poignant moment, his brother good-heartedly pranks him into believing that \"the home minister, who is responsible for happy homes, would soon pass a law changing the value of pi from 3.14159 to just 3, making it easier for all Indian children to calculate the area of a circle\". Thoma is whom we root for, desperately hoping that things would turn out all right for the guy who, even for stepping out of his house, has to motivate himself with the mantra \"Fight, Thoma, put fight\" (a mantra that I myself use often these days). Unni Chacko is like the hole in a donut -- he is not even there, but the whole fuss is about him. The revelation of Unni Chacko's character through the perspectives of people around him and their reminisces make a legend out of him. Unni was a \"seventeen-year-old cartoonist, an exceptional cartoonist, but too young to accept that subtlety is not always a mask of mediocrity\". And to dvelve into the character, Manu Jospeh shows us glimpses of the themes of Unni's cartoons. The themes leave us in no-doubt about the brilliance of the young artist. We also discover that Unni had no discernible reason to end his life. He was much loved by everyone, he was a star, and people around him looked up to him. He was cute, and girls adored him. He seemed like the happiest person in the Chacko family, in their colony, and beyond. His death causes sadness in most, and relief in some (for it is \"the tragic defeat of the unusual, and so the triumph of the normal\"). But it shocks everyone. Through Oesop's digging, we realize the other facets of Unni's character, and we discover that things were not as simple as they seemed on the surface. We also get to discover his multiple theories, on good and evil, on delusions, on happiness and other philosophical questions. Alas, \"adolescence is a dangerous period in the lives of philosophically oriented males\". Almost all adults in Illicit Happiness of Other People are quirky (with the possible exception of one Dr. Iyengar). It is adolescents that the story focuses on, and we have various adolescents trying to handle the unfair burden of hope and responsibility placed on them. We have \"Sai, the error in nature’s trial and error\". Sai is Manu Joseph's caricature of a Tamil Brahmin boy -- selfish, hypocritical, ambitious, but shallow. \"I am done with all this. I am an ordinary person, I want ordinary things. I don’t want to know the truth. I don’t want to see beauty. I am just another boy in Madras who wants to escape to America\", he declares in a moment of self-acceptance. There is the brainy Balki, who provides a much needed turn-around in Chacko's investigation. \"He was the star, I was just the brilliant guy\", he declares comparing himself with Unni. He also gives Manu Jospeh the opportunity to bring in one of his most important thoughts : \"It is the misanthrope alone who has clarity. By standing outside the huddle of men, he sees a lot, and what he often sees is the evidence that people are not as smart as dogs think they are. In the fog of ambiguities and mysteries, he desperately searches for truths because truth usually shows humanity in a poor light\". And there is the all important Mythilli Balasubramanium, a neighborhood girl \u0026nbsp;who grew up adoring Unni and being adored by Thoma.\u0026nbsp; Manu Jospeh has a lot of acerbic observations to make about everything. I was initially put off with his relentlessly negative portrayal of Madras until I realized that this guy is relentlessly negative about most things. And then, I started enjoying it much more. Like Oscar Wilde, he throws up aphorisms which sound attractive but are not necessarily true. On men, he says : \"Those old men who are so starved for flesh that they fondle children, fondle fully grown men, furtively flap their thighs when they watch women’s tennis on TV\". On male friendships, he has these : \"that any two men in the world have real affection between them is itself a myth, chiefly of the two men\" and \"the contempt of a male for a smarter friend\". He does not spare the other side consisting of rationalists and atheists too : \"proud self-congratulatory way of young atheists\" and \"rationalists think all god-men are frauds. That is the problem with rationalists. They are not rational enough.\" He has this on social workers \"some of them, our living saints, do not realize that they are actually sadists who enjoy watching human misery from very close\". And this on socialists : \"All this will go one day, the animal poverty, it will vanish. And future generations will not know, will not even guess, the true nature of poverty, which is the longest heritage of man. Shouldn’t this be preserved somehow, like old colonial buildings, shouldn’t abject poverty be preserved as historical evidence? That is what socialists are trying to do in this country. Everybody misunderstands their intentions. They are noble conservationists, working hard to preserve a way of the World.\" There are a gazillion of important minor characters - a strict aglo-Indian teacher, cartoonists named Alpha and Beta, a walking corpse, a psychologist, a moustached man from a cartoon and a cruel mother-in-law. As Chacko keeps meeting people, he discovers a lot about his son. \"No matter what their delusions are, parents do not really know their children.\" The legend of Unni is so built that the mystery becomes almost unfathomable, and a bit of super-natural is thrown in. \u0026nbsp;As a result, the logical solution seems a bit forced, brought in through a deus ex machina. But you realize that there are not many other ways the plot could have been resolved, and you cut some slack for the writing prowess of Manu Joseph. And there are important take-aways from this forced-ending too. The Illicit Happiness of Other people has had a profound impact on me. I would definitely recommend it. It is wonderful to see so many outstanding books by Indian authors, set in places you can relate with and with characters you have met. In my list, Manu Jospeh is in as much regard as Salman Rushdie, Arundathi Roy and Arvind Adiga. Before I leave you, here is the plot description of Enlightenment - one of Unni's numerous cartoons. I really wish someone made these into real comics. In Enlightenment, a sage in robes is meditating; he is sitting on a high snowy peak. Seasons change, storms pass, but nothing bothers him. He gets a massive erection, which subsides in time, but the man is undisturbed, unaware of what is happening to him and around him. Mountain climbers arrive with their national flags and leave disappointed when they find someone already on the summit. The sage becomes very old, his beard turns white. Finally, he becomes radiant. A halo appears behind him. He has achieved enlightenment. He opens his eyes looking totally stunned. He screams, 'Shit, I am a cartoon.'

Such urges have an uncanny ability to creep in exactly when there is not a single good book within reach. But they are also compulsive, and I couldn't give up. I scoured my uncle's place thoroughly, and located a few books that I had to do with. One of them was this interesting looking book that you see below. Since my work is related vaguely to the oil and gas industry, I decided to do something that I seldom do : mix business with pleasure. Oil for the World by Stewart Schackne and D'Arcy Drake was published in 1955. The book seems to be extremely rare - Amazon has a used copy of it, but it is available neither on Wikipedia nor on Goodreads. The short book talks about the myriad benefits of oil and various oil products, gives a brief introduction on the history of discovery of oil, touches upon the common methods of oil extraction and exploration, and lays down a prediction of the usefulness of oil in the future. Considering the pace at which technology is advancing, it is amazing to think that a technical book written 60 years ago has a few things that are still relevant today. What interested me the most is the tone of the whole book. The authors, if one can take the privilege to judge a writer by his writing, seem to be from a right-leaning political ideology. The book is clearly meant for an American audience and might not have been expected to trot around the globe, but a conviction of the greatness of America emanates throughout the book. And the tone is infectiously enthusiastic, detailing about all the known uses of oil, and how new oil-rich regions were continuously being discovered. It also stresses the idea that the potential of oil was not yet realized, and that oil was not being used as much as it should have been. Obviously, it is impossible for the authors to have predicted a future where oil would be an extremely expensive product, apart from being exhaustible resource with harmful consequences to the environment. Today, we fight wars over oil. Children are killed for oil. Growing up in such an environment, it amused me to no-end to notice the optimistic tone this book repeatedly takes while talking about the oil reserve remaining in the Earth. It is as if the authors believed that there is an unlimited supply of oil. Or even more likely, they severely under-estimated the human capacity to consume oil. Imagine this happening to us sixty years later. Visualize a bored guy with nothing better to do coming across our writings, and laughing at us taking for granted a thing that would become rare in his time; a thing that would cause wars, deaths, and destruction all around. What could such a thing be? Frankly, I have no idea. But let me engage my fantasies, and venture a wild guess : Happiness! Imagine us using up happiness as if it is an unlimited resource, only to find that it is formed by the fossilized remains of dead people, and we need to wait for more people to die and be processed before we could extract any more happiness. Imagine that us being recklessly happy is gradually boring a hole in the Ozone layer, letting in more harmful radiations. Picture a day when our children grow up to find that there is no more happiness left around. Do you really want such a bleak future for our children? Don't you want to be sustainable? Shouldn't we take more care that we don't waste happiness, and use it more optimally? Happiness is positive energy, as it is drilled often into us. And we all know that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can be only transferred from one (human) form to another. So, at any moment when you encountering exhilarating happiness, at whose cost is it?\u0026nbsp; Fine, I will admit it. That is extremely stupid. My wild guess is too wild, and does not have a single shred of logic in it. It is ludicrous. But my preposterous theory is just a response to an equally ludicrous, if not more, news item that provoked me. As per the news item, Chief Happiness Officer is a new job description that is attaining prominence in silicon valley corporations. Following the lead of Google, supposed to be one of the best employers around, these companies are monitoring how happy their employees are, and \u0026nbsp;attempting to increase the happiness of their employees. In this quest, the employees are subject to constant surveillance. And why are they doing this? They are implementing ideas from \"scientific studies\" that show that happier employees are more productive that normal employees. I feel extremely unsettled by this. Think of what could happen when corporates start monitoring the happiness of their employees and potential employees. For instance, a potential employee who has just lost a family member would have unfair hurdles in getting a job, as he/she might \"lower the productivity\" of the company. The whole idea is Orwellian.\nI wonder how such studies measure happiness, a term that is excessively vague. As as example of its vagueness, consider the entry for Happiness in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\u0026nbsp;(a very useful website for people who want to understand Philosophy, and people like me who want to pretend that they do). The entry starts by mentioning that there are two different senses of using the word \"Happiness\", remarks that both of them are often confused with each other, and then goes on to use the term in both senses confusingly. Study or no study, happiness is ill-defined, and over-rated - at least in one sense of the word. Here is a comic that tries to explore the two facets of happiness.\nAdmittedly, it can be argued that momentary happiness is just caused by enzymes such as Serotonin. Studies have shown that running makes people happy. Drugs can make one happy, at least temporarily. Thinking that one is happy makes one happy. In fact, a casual glance at any social networks makes it seem like everyone everywhere is happy. \"I enjoyed my weekend with curd rice and pickle at Muniyandi Vilas. The pickle was a bit salty, but the curd rice was delicious. \u0026nbsp;Had a wonderful time with my best-friends\" [attach all-smiles selfie with incompatible roommates, and then fight over whose turn it is to pay the bill]. But again, happiness caused in such an unnatural way does not last for long. Are such momentary pleasures what we desire? While the previous generation was burdened by conservative and close-knitted societies that hated novelty, we are burdened by a desire to show the World that we love our lives. Those who don't become social outcasts by an unspoken code of modern society.\nHappy birthday, happy new year, happy holidays, happy weekend, happy married life, happy-second-anniversary-of-the-day-you-came-third-in-lemon-and-spoon-race, happy 14/14/2014, happy pets day, happy this and happy that. We are always expected to be happy, and we constantly feel the need to be happy, or at least project that we are happy. The French revolution changed all existing ideals in life. Until then, religion was the highest virtue. People were more worried about happiness after death than happiness in life. While the revolution brought in a welcome change, it seems that we are gradually moving towards another extreme; of valuing ourselves, our passions, our abilities, and our pleasures too highly.\nWhat we need is an acceptance of the fact that happiness is just a part of life, and there a myriad other emotions we need to learn to deal with. We need to realize that it is okay to be sad. Like Seneca famously quipped \"What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears\". It might seem as if I am an advocate of pessimism, and I probably am. But I don't think so, for all I want is a little bit of moderation. And the only way to deal with ludicrous excesses of optimism is with some excessive pessimism. Which is why, my (current) favorite living Philosopher is Alain De Botton. After watching a few of his talks, I have finally managed to start reading his boook : The Consolations of Philosophy. Google him, check out his talks, and read his articles. \"We are not only unhappy, but also— believing calm and happiness to be the norm—unhappy that we’re unhappy\", he says in an article, and I completely agree with him. No wonder we have people who seem to possess every reason to be happy, and are still depressed. Happiness is probably a limited resource, after all.\nOn that note, my most favorite piece of writing on Happiness is by a blogger I was introduced to by a friend. What great economy of words and an amazing ability to create metaphors! Here is this blogger's take on The Poetry of Happiness :\nThe poetry of happiness depends on an element of surprise. It is lithe and built like a jungle cat. Adept in the art of camouflage, capable of consummate stillness and able to traverse large distances with great velocity. In ill-advised moments you find yourself stalking it through the jungle of the day with your too-loud feet and bad-timing (your species was not built for stalking). Later, in an unguarded moment, happiness will pounce on you. Roll you to the floor with soft paws and sit on your stomach gleefully. Joy will swallow you whole. Because you are prey to happiness. And always have been. Not the other way around. It. Has. Never. Been. The other way around.

Occasionally, these decisions depend on factors such as intelligence, an ability to work hard, diplomacy, body odour, skin colour, race, religion, sex, communication skills and place of birth (not in any specific order). But most often, these crucial decisions are made by a God person, who spins a roulette and lets you take one way if he gets an even number and the other if he gets an odd number. If you are an atheist, you may want to call this as Randomness. After all, who is to say that intelligence and an ability to work hard are not just genetic accidents?

I carry my closest friend as noiselessly as I can into the desolation. Sigh! He is heavy. I lumber and pant for a few minutes, retracing the path I took a while back, and reach the spot I had marked earlier with a spade. I place him on the ground gently, but his head hits the ground harder then I expected it to. Damn! I don't want to hurt him. Not that he would feel any pain. Muttering a silent apology, I lift the spade off the ground, and start digging. I don't have enough time. Soon, early morning travelers will pass by on their way to Lonavala. I finish digging a hole. It looks pretty shabby, but it will have to do. I pause silently for a few minutes to see if there is any noise that does not belong in the night and glance around quickly. Nothing. I try to avoid looking at the eyes of the person I admired the most, eyes that had been alluring and all-knowing, eyes that are just dead now. I lift him with care, and lay him softly inside the pit, making sure that his head touches the ground softly this time. I stand back to take a look at my handiwork. His shirt is creased near the chest, and I flatten the crease with my hands.\n*** He didn't like creased shirts. He had been fastidious about clothes for as long as I could remember. He joined us at Gladden Orphanage when I was thirteen. He had been eleven. For me, life had become a routine, and I tried to be as happy as I could under the circumstances. Like all the boys around me, I lived in the present. He had been different though, always looking towards the future. With the cruelty of children, we did everything in our power to make him like us; languorous and laid-back. Fatty Farook had been the most ardent among us. I had been the least. We could sense that he wanted to get out of the hellhole. We laughed at his ambition, at his optimism, at his belief that he would one day beat the skewed system. He showed us didn't he? He reached the top of the very system, albeit briefly. He would have risen higher, if I had not intervened. I shuddered at the thought of what I have done.\nBy the time he left Gladden's, I was seventeen, and the closest thing he had to a friend in that whole bleak place. With all due modesty, his need for me then had been more than my need for him. Throughout his short stay, he had made enemies due to his ambition, and I had to stand up for him. In return, he valiantly tried teaching me to read English. He did not belong with us, and I was glad that he left; for his own good. A scholarship at a leading private school awaited him. His parting gift for me was a book, his favorite : Robinson Crusoe. Ironically, it was twenty eight years before we met again.\nHe barely needed me when I was forty five. I was one of those billions of people just trudging along life with a bare minimum of education. \u0026nbsp;I was still around the orphanage, doing a motley of jobs, running all sorts of errands. Some called it allegiance, but it was probably a simple lack of opportunities elsewhere. I was, of course, unmarried, what with the male-female ratio and all that. Driving a pick-up loaded with some half-broken furniture for the children, I was surprised to see an expensive car standing in the driveway of Gladden's. We rarely had adoptions. Even the charitable expect some standards before they could be generous. I didn't recognize him when I spotted him chatting with the caretaker. It was only after he noticed me, exclaimed gladly, came forward to shake my hands amicably, and introduced himself did I recollect the eyes, and then his face. It was probably an indication of how little I had changed, and how much he had changed. Knowing him, I shouldn't have been; but I was surprised that this rich man in branded garb had once grown up with me, and needed me. He had become a Features Editor of a popular magazine based in Mumbai. I was a nobody. We talked for a few hours. We went around the village in his brand-new car, a nostalgic cruise for him, yet another trip through nauseatingly familiar terrain for me. He wanted to offer me some money, but I was too proud to accept it. He was too persistent. It had to be a job then. \"What can you do?\", he asked. Everything. And nothing.\nI packed my sparse belongings, including the copy of Robinson Crusoe, and moved with him to Bombay. I was to be his personal driver, however my job description had not changed much. I still had to do a variety of errands. But I loved it. Once again, I was content too soon with what life was offering me. That's how I have always been. Him, on the other hand; he kept growing in popularity and reputation. His ambition was matched only by his tirelessness. He was constantly busy. Though he made it a point to inquire on my well-being every morning, there were no conversations as such. Not yet. I didn't mind it. I had too much respect for what he had become and how he conducted himself to worry about such petty things. I still have much respect for him.\nApart from his Editorial work, he was working on a novel. It was while working on this book, about a writer not completely sure of his own abilities, that madame killed herself. The doctors concluded that it had been due to depression. She had been weird even as a child. There was a police inquiry, but they realized soon that no one was to blame. Asha madam, his daughter, didn't seem to agree though. She blamed her father, and accused him of being negligent. She forbade herself from talking to him.\nHis daughter's silence affected him more than his wife's loss. His way of battling sadness was through working hard. He finished his first novel, which won him much praise all over. I bought a copy for myself as soon as it was published, but gave up on it. His writing was too tough to follow. It was not until recently, after patient efforts to improve my vocabulary all through my spare time, was I able to read the book completely. Needless to say, I think the book is wonderfully written. He also quit his job and founded his own magazine. In five years, he had recruited tough, no-nonsense journalists; conducted various sting operations; exposed numerous corrupt bureaucrats and ministers; and become a reputed name throughout the nation. His wife's death made him magnanimous. He was generous to anyone who wanted assistance. I would be sent to Gladden's twice every year to personally ensure that they had everything they needed. It was around this time that he started conversing with me. He would confess his insecurities, and offer his observations. I was an attentive student, always amazed by his knowledge of the ways of the World, and filled with an ostentatious display of admiration. \u0026nbsp;His one vice -- he insisted on calling it a vice -- was his charm. He would always be able to get people to do what he wanted, without even letting them realize it. Women always fell for his eyes, and his ready wit. At Gladden's, these traits had been of no use; but in his social circle, these were the very traits that won him adulation. Through all these, he also managed to finish his second book, a contemplative book on the state of women in the country - \"What Turns Men into Beasts\". Once again, I brought myself a copy as soon as it was published, and this time, I was able to finish reading it quickly. The book had modern ideas on how women need to be treated. I initially found it tough to digest. But as I thought about it, along with the fact that he was seldom wrong, I did see sense in it. I read it a second time, and fell in love with it. I marked the most lucid of lines with a pencil, and copied them to a notebook. He was proud of the book too. When I mentioned about my notebook in the passing, he smiled. \"Never trust people, people change, but words don't\", he would tell me. \"The best way to respect a person is to respect their words\". \u0026nbsp;The book was raved about by the critics, and won an award -- a statuette with his name engraved in it -- from the Goa literary festival. The statuette had been his most prized possession.\n***\nIt is getting late. I can't stand here reminiscing all day. Not that I mind getting caught, but I owe myself a chance at the least. Lifting the statuette from my back pocket, I place it beside him. His hands are covered with rashes. Rashes that had not been there yesterday, when I had offered him his last cup of coffee. Strong, with extra sugar. And some arsenic. Picking up the spade to fill the gaping and conspicuous hole, I look\u0026nbsp;for the last time\u0026nbsp;at the man who had trusted me with his life. He looks at peace with himself.\n*** I had been with him for six years when he met Rituji. By now, Asha madam had partly reconciled with her father. As he confessed to me later, \"time and love healed what it could\". Asha madam introduced her friend, a budding journalist, to her father. He quickly anticipated her request, and offered Rituji a job. Rituji turned out to be an enthusiastic apprentice, quickly learning the tricks of her trade. Like me, she revered him. Her talent, and probably his personal attention towards her, enabled her to sidestep many and climb up the corporate ladder quickly, all within a couple of years. For this year's Idea Festival -- organized by his magazine as India's most eclectic, thought-provoking and egalitarian platform for ideas from across the globe -- she was assigned as the personal escort for the most important guests. The festival was held in Goa. I stayed back at Mumbai, as I was supposed to drive Asha madam to the Idea Festival a couple of days after the festival begun. It was on our way to Goa that Asha madam received the phone call. The call seemed to have come from Rituji, and Asha madam sounded quite upset after the call. I was asked to directly drive to Grand Hyatt hotel. It took me a little more that forty minutes to reach the driveway of the Grand Hyatt. Rituji was waiting outside, looking agitated. We picked her up, and I was asked to drive to the Crown. Strangely, as I picked her up and reversed out of the driveway, I spotted him in the rear-view mirror. For the first time ever, he looked remorseful. \u0026nbsp;I could hear snatches of the conversation from the backseat as we drove away. The word \"molested\" was repeated several times, along with \"second time\" and \"elevator\". \"I saw him doing this to a woman when I was thirteen, so it doesn't surprise me anymore\", said Asha madam. A couple of days later, in Mumbai, he confessed to me. He regretted his \"lapse of judgement\", but it seemed that his daughter's awareness caused him to repent more than the incident itself.\n*** My watch shows 03:43 as I finish covering the hole with mud. I take a step back to take in my work. Again,\u0026nbsp;It looks pretty shabby, but it will have to do.\u0026nbsp;I don't have much time now. Where will I go next? I will have to abandon the car here. Of course, it will lead them to him. But he deserves to be found before he decays. I owe him that. I will walk towards Lonavala, there is a bus stand a few\u0026nbsp;kilometers\u0026nbsp;down. And take a bus somewhere. A final visit to Gladden's perhaps. Gladden's will miss his generous donations. But he had been a principled man, and he would have understood why I did it. He might have approved too. I will miss him, and his wisdom. I look at his grave for one last time.

As always, I might be completely mistaken. But -- to phrase it like a man of science for once -- all available facts lead to the undeniable conclusion that the probability of me suffering from this disease is quite high. You know what? I think you suffer from this disease too. In fact, I think most people I have encountered in life suffer from it. If all normal people suffer from a disease, is it even a disease anymore? Would it be an \"abnormal\" condition, as diseases ought to be? But I am getting ahead of myself here. Who am I to conclude that you suffer from this condition? You would never concede the fact. You would deny it outright. All I can be sure of, if one can be sure of things, is that I suffer from it. For all I know, you don't. Or do you? Do you, like me, suffer from the disease of Inconsistency? Inconsistency would not be such a worrying thing, if not for the human tendency to look for consistency everywhere. We look for identifiable patterns, and try to fit things into them. As soon as we sense a compromise to the pattern, we work hard to set it right. But grant things a glance that is more than cursory, and you will realize that there are no patterns. Early last month, I temporarily gave up my watching-sports-takes-lot-of-time-so-dont-watch policy by watching a couple of matches. The second match I watched was the Wimbledon final, where Federer and Djokovic battled for the throne. I almost gave up my dinner to watch Federer show a glimpse of his much-talked-about old self (I haven't seen much Tennis). Whilst Federer was playing like a spectator-magnet, Djokovic was just there, just good enough, and almost lucky to hold on to the match. As soon as the match was over, there was a barrage of opinions, most of which spoke about Federer. I wondered why, for despite the fact that I had myself felt Federer had been the better player that day, Djokovic had won. He managed to stick it out when things were bad, and made most of the opportunities he got. Isn't that what Tennis is all about : winning? How would it feel to be Djokovic, to win and to still fend of questions about his opponent? In an otherwise Utilitarian World, where the end justifies the means, why were we attracted more towards Federer, instead of Djoker (I am obviously discounting past records, and talking about the particular match)?\nJust a day before, I had watched my first sports match in a long, long time. MCC XI vs Rest of the World XI boasted so many big names that I had been waiting in anticipation for long. Sachin, Lara, Warne, Murali, and most importantly -- Rahul Dravid. My fandom of Rahul Dravid was such that I gave up watching cricket when he stopped playing. All my wait for one more innings from him turned out anti-climatically, as he out was out bowled the first ball he faced. The much-acclaimed wall had his defense broken. That's all right, I told myself, and recalled all the good memories he had given me. With Rahul Dravid, the method of scoring runs was more important that the runs themselves. If runs were more important, I had argued numerous times with friends, I would rather watch a fast-ticking scoreboard. If runs are the only thing that is important, watching a couple of kids playing book cricket would be much more engaging. My firm belief was that the means justify the end, and not the other way round. Where was the consistency?\nThe first thing I learnt about a corporate environment is that people are seldom concerned with how you do things, as long as you get them done. Why should we evaluate people from the cini-industry any differently? After all, a cinema is usually a commercial product that aims to make money; a fact that only a few directors (like Vetrimaran) admit frankly. So, when a Kamal Hassan talks about how long he had to wear an unnecessary make-up, or someone praises director Bala for his authenticity in making a movie, I quickly dismiss it as humbug. Yet, when I see a movie like Rope (Alfred Hitchcock), I can't help wonder about the logistic hurdles that had to be surpassed in shooting it. Take this scene by Tarkovskey from a movie that I am yet to watch. There is not much that is engaging about this scene, but it never stops fascinating me. How could they have calculated the exact time that would take for the mansion to burn, and time the shot perfectly? But why am I so worried about how the shot was made, instead of how it looks in the end? You see the inconsistency in me?\nI could go on and on about my inconsistencies, but I guess I have made my point. Let's talk about you a little. You, as in the general public, and not the individual you. When Preity Zinta accused her (former) boyfriend Ness Wadia of abusing her, you questioned the fact the he was after all her boyfriend. \"Why had she been silent all this time, and choose to accuse him now?\", you asked. You didn't factor in the possibility that she just changed her mind about him, that she could be inconsistent. When politician actress-turned-Nagma slapped a guy for molesting her in public, questions were raised about her selective outrage. The fact that she could choose to be inconsistent in deciding what is okay for her did not occur to some of you.\nHave you ever tried changing yourselves, for good or for bad? You are invariably met with resistance from people who expect you to behave a certain way. Ask a smoker who is trying to quit when he still has smoker friends. Things could be easier if only we embrace the fact that we are inconsistent, that we do not fit into patterns, that we could not be studied, and that our reactions could not be predicted. Sartre deals with this profound concept in his beautiful novel, The Age of Reason. Alas, his protagonist Mathieu gets trapped into a pattern of trying not to be fit into any pattern. Once again, we get to see that Socrates was wrong, that there is a vast gap between knowing the right thing to do and doing it. But knowing is a first step. Let us at least recognize that we are bound to be inconsistent.\nPS : The title is inspired from George Carlin's stand up routine -- You are all diseased\n","date":"27 July 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/we-are-all-diseased/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"We Are All Diseased","type":"posts"},{"content":" \"Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted more\" A little more than nine months ago, I reviewed the book Little Women\u0026nbsp;on my blog. My chief issue with the book which I loved otherwise, was that it was morally preachy. I was not comfortable with the general idea that the book imparts; that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. At that point of time -- and I am narcissistically about to quote myself here, thereby entering the annals of quoting people as the first ever (and only?) person to quote me -- I felt that \"life is more like a movie directed by Coen Brothers, filled with absolutely random justice\". How much reversal of opinion is a person allowed to make within nine months? I always take the liberty of reversing opinions to the largest extent possible. So here I am, gushing over Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment for the very same reason that had made me feel skeptical about Little Women. A little digging around the things that influenced my mood when I started Dostoevsky's epic, for I am a moody person, tells me that I had watched a few episodes of Breaking Bad. The idea of Walter White slowly turning immoral, while simultaneously becoming more \"cool\" made me feel a little uncomfortable. Crime and Punishment brushed off all such discomfort, and I am giving it two thumbs up. It is ironic that I wanted to read Crime and Punishment only because I had felt that\u0026nbsp;Match Point,\u0026nbsp;Woody Allen's reinterpretation of the Russian novel, to be brilliant. Match Point's central theme is the role that randomness plays in life. But halfway through Crime and Punishment, I was pretty sure that I did not want the fate of Rodion Raskolnikov, a cold blooded killer, to be decided by luck. His crime needed a punishment. Rodion Rashkolnikov is the ideal protagonist, for he is a loner; someone who feels the company of outside people too dull for his intelligence. He is the sort of protagonist that most readers will instantly root for. After all, almost every single one of us has moments when we think that the society is not good enough for us, when we get exasperated at the lack of intelligence of the collective, and consider ourselves as iconoclasts. Most of us are in denial about the fact that we, almost without exception, are the \"average\" in an average society (Dostovskey might not agree with me though. In a different context, he says \"A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among dozens – perhaps hundreds of thousands – hardly one is to be met with\"). Rodion is an impecunious student from pre-revolution, pre-communist Russia; an ex-student, for he has discontinued his studies. A man of strong character, the kind who forms his own ideas rather than adopting someone else's, he is in constant need of tiny amounts of money to lead his ascetic life.\nAlyona Ivanovna is an old pawnbroker, some one who is \"a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case\". In his idleness, as a thought experiment, Rodion forms a plot to murder this old woman, and reasons that his action would result in more good for the World than evil. Working through moral dilemmas, mental anguish, and a bit of fortune (\"when reason fails, the devil helps!\"), he goes on to commit the crime. Crime and Punishment deals with the aftermath of the crime : the mental anguish that Rodion deals with due to his actions.\nCrime and Punishment is a classic in most senses of the word. One sense in which it is not a classic is that it is not very tedious to read. At times, it might even qualify to be called as gripping. Dostoevsky obviously knew his craft well. The writing is simply brilliant. He packs the novel with outstanding observations of the human mind. If I could write a single sentence with \u0026nbsp;as much wisdom as Dostoevsky doles out sentence after sentence, I would consider myself a genius. Take \"Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!\", or \"A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go.. that way.. to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered with\", or \"There are instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that? But it’s particularly so with women\" and so on and on and on.\nHis characterization is stunning too. There are only a few characters, and everyone has a part to play. What mind-bogging power of observation must Dostoevsky have had! He lays bare the deepest motive of every single character in a way that is unsettling, for I kept comparing myself to various characters. We have Pulcheria Alexandrova, Rodion's mother, who is \"emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross\". His sister Avdotya, who is a woman of dignity. A strong minded woman who is fiercely independent. \"Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you do not have either?\", she asks Rodion. \u0026nbsp;We have Sofia, who is a bundle of unpolluted goodness, someone who hopes even in the most hopeless of situations. \"To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones\", says Rodion in her defense, and rightly so. Porfiry, as the detective in-charge of finding the murderer brings in a bit of investigative angle, and a lot of psychological mind games. \"The general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at all\", says Porfiry. There is the mystical\u0026nbsp;Marmeladov, who knows everything that is wrong with him, but is still unable to remedy it. He is proof that Socrates was wrong: knowing the right thing to does not automatically lead us to doing it. \u0026nbsp;And we have\u0026nbsp;Svidrigailov, the most complex of all characters (\"Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about virtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am sinful man”).\nMy most favorite character is\u0026nbsp;Razumihin. He is the loyal friend, seeing only the good in the World. Razumihin never loses trust in the basic virtues of kindness and friendliness. He is a man of \"vulgar politeness\". He is also extremely rational, but has enough sense to realize that one does not always allow reason to dictate terms. To me, Razumihin is the hero, the character who shows us how not to allow pure logic to dictate terms. \"You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions!\", he argues. To him, nothing is more important than a single individual. He does not commit the folly that\u0026nbsp;Rashkolnikov\u0026nbsp;does, of thinking of humanity as more important that an individual. How often do you see characters that\u0026nbsp;need to be given importance being shunned aside, so that the protagonist is built up? Most writers would gladly reduce Razumuhin to a wise-cracking sidekick. Such mistakes are for lesser writers. Dostoevsky is firm control though, and he does not let us down.\nThe central theme of Crime and Punishment is that of \"superman\" -- that theory which connects Friedrich Nietzsche, Adolf Hitler, and Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. Rodion believes the laws are defined for ordinary people, and do not hold true for \"great\" people under certain circumstances.\nI maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been known except by sacrificing the lives of one,a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have the right, would indeed be duty bound.. to eliminate the dozen or hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries know to the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that Newton has a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market With a touch of genius, Dostoevsky deals with a myriad other themes too. Alienation from society is one. The nature of crime is a very important recurring theme. \u0026nbsp;\"Crime is a protest\u0026nbsp;against\u0026nbsp;the abnormality of the\u0026nbsp;social\u0026nbsp;organisation, and nothing more; no other causes admitted…. From which it follows that, if a society is\u0026nbsp;normally organized, all crime will cease at once\" is opposed with a \"A man of forty violates a child of ten; was it environment (that) drove him to it?\". Which brings us to the key aspect of Dostoevsky's writing : Despite his immense wisdom, not once does he come across as patronizing. He does not even stop to judge his own characters. All his observations are passed with a detachment, a sort of this-is-how-things-are-and-they-can't-be-helped tone. He writes with a resignation that almost gives up on humanity getting any better, and I love him for it. The most we can do with human nature is understand it, there is not much we can do to remedy it.\nIf I have to look hard for a flip side, one needs a grasp of all the themes in the story to enjoy it better. I have always believed that there is a right time for reading classics. Too early, and you risk alienation from a wonderful book. But there is no question of whether the book is to be read. Crime and Punishment is one of the best books I have ever read. I am stopping just short of calling it a must-read, for I have a feeling that Dostoevsky might not have approved of laying down what one must do and what one must not do.\nImage Source :\u0026nbsp;http://atapestryofwords.blogspot.com/2013/01/top-ten-tuesday-most-frustrating.html ","date":"12 July 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/thoughts-on-crime-and-punishment/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Thoughts on Crime and Punishment","type":"posts"},{"content":" \"Like most misery, it started with apparent happiness\" - Markus Zusak, through \"Death\" in The Book Thief Does this review contain spoilers? I honestly don't think so. On that note though, here is a quote from The Book Thief Of course, I’m being rude. I’m spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have give you two events in advance, because I don’t have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It’s the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me. The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a fairly modern novel, but it is yet another story set during World War 2 Germany. The Book Thief reminds me -- due to my own ability/snag of relating completely unrelated things -- a lot of Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz; another profound book. Both The Book Thief and Odd Thomas are stories set in the backdrop of immense tragedies, and told with an unexpected sense of humour. The narrators in both the stories seem to be attempting to gloss over the tragic parts by narrating the events with a detachment. The tragedy is so pronounced in both the stories that it still manages to creep in, with far more impact than it would have otherwise. Odd Thomas is mostly about the struggles of one person in dealing with his tragedies, whereas The Book Thief is about the tragedy of a country, or even humanity as a whole.\nMarkus Zusak wastes no time in capturing the reader's attention. He does this by using the unlikeliest of narrators -- death. The very idea keeps you engaged throughout. It is interesting to think of death to be as fascinated about humans as we are about death. The narrative style is extremely bold and unorthodox. There are fore-warnings and there are sometimes-diverting asides that highlight key points (as if you are reading a technical manual). To tell a story, and to tell it well, with such an unconventional style requires an excellent command over vocabulary, and Markus Zusak pulls it off brilliantly. The Book Thief is Liesel, a young girl beset on all sides by tragedy. She is a survivor, \"an expert at being left behind\". Circumstances take her to a town called Molching (apparently, it translates from German to heaven), where she lives with foster parents. The Book Thief is the testament to the power of books, the power of words, to take us through immense tragedies. The Book Thief is also about the good that remains in people, and manifests itself in the most unlikeliest of circumstances. It is about humanity, which is made up of \"so much good, so much evil\". It is about a girl who learns to read, to write, and to get through great loss. For a book attempting to deal with such a vast subject, it has very few characters. There is Hans Hubberman , Liesel's foster father, who is\u0026nbsp; ..barely visible. An-un-special person. Certainly, his painting skills were excellent. His musical ability was better than average. Somehow, though, and I’m sure you've met people like this, he was able to appear as merely part of the background, even if he was standing in front of a line. He was always just there. Not noticeable. Not important or particularly valuable. Hans Hubberman manages to win hearts though, and he does it through \"the brute strength of the man’s gentleness, his thereness\". There is his wife Rosa who possesses \"the unique ability to aggravate almost anyone she ever met\" , but is still a \"good woman for a crisis\". There is the endearing Rudy Steiner, Liesel's partner-in-arms and best friend, who does not hesitate to exercise his \"God-given right to stupidity\". There is Max -- someone who is forced to live a life filled with guilt and shame for no fault of his own. And there is Ilsa Herman, who \"had decided to make suffering her triumph. When it refused to let go of her, she succumbed to it. She embraced it\". Add to this a few \"cameo\u0026nbsp;appearances\" from other minor characters, and you have the town of Molching. Each of these characters is extremely well etched out, though Zusak seems to shower special attention on Hans and Rudy. Apart from Liesel, that is. The Book Thief leaves you in no doubt about the writing prowess of Markus Zusak. He extensively uses the technique of Anthromorphism. Take this for example\nOh, how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky. Great obese clouds. Dark and plump. Bumping into each other. Apologizing. Moving on and finding room. And Zusak does not moralize. It helps a lot that the narrator is impersonal -- can anything be more impersonal than death? There are general observations that creep in though, remarks made in the passing, such as \"I guess humans like to watch little destructions. Sand castles, houses of cards, that’s where they begin. Their great skill is their capacity to escalate.\", and more trivially, \"No one’s urine smells as good as your own\". These are completely non-judgmental though, and the tone is strictly that of wonder and incomprehension at the extremes of human behavior.\u0026nbsp;\nThe flip sides I had with the book are probably out of my own doing. I had to squeeze in time to read the book, and barely managed to hurry through a few pages each day. It took me a month to finish it (despite the fact it is seldom dull) . But I did feel that the book didn't really live up to the expectations I had of it. I didn't get the broader point of the whole novel. And when a writer reveals the end prematurely, \"the machinations that wheel us there\" must carry the whole burden of the plot. The Book Thief falters a little in that regard, like another highly acclaimed work -- The White Tiger by Arvind Adiga. Despite all these probable faults, which might not be faults at all if I had read the book as I ought to have, the writing keeps you very engaged, and there are characters worth loving and recalling (Rosa and Hans are my favorites). I would recommend this read without any hesitation.\nAnd regarding Markus Zusak, I am looking forward to read more by him, and would be starting as soon as I can with his other books. We have a potentially great modern author, and we better keep a close eye on him.

This is the undefiable law of nature. Let us momentarily assume that stones have a heart, a conscience, and self-awareness. Let us assume that a stone can hold desires and strive for these desires. \u0026nbsp;The immediate impact of this would be that the phrase \"stone-hearted\" would have to be replaced with a different phrase, but let us leave that to those nameless people who are usually concerned about such things. What we are more concerned about is a single stone, a stone that wishes to defy the Universal law of Gravity, at the least, temporarily. It wishes to go up in the air, stay there for as long as it wants, and to come back down to the Earth, if at all, at its own terms. Would I be exaggerating if I claim that this stone wants to be free? You see that little image over there? I took it from a website that gives a \"daily dose of inspiration\". On another day, I will vent out my thoughts and rant my feelings about motivational quotes in general, and how they -- with only a negligible exception -- make me feel demotivated. For now, I will just point out the inappropriateness of that image for that quote; for a feather is never free. A feather is dictated by winds, by gravity, by its weight -- factors that are completely out of its control. A feather, it occurs to me, is among the most un-free things around us. But what do I know? I took it from a website which has some zillion more hits on an average than my blog, and apparently, such combinations of images and texts are successful in motivating people and making them feel better. If you are one of those people who get motivated by these, I sincerely and wholeheartedly envy you. What is true freedom, then? Does my freedom lie in the ability to speak out my impulsive thoughts and call someone ugly after just glancing at them? Does my freedom lie in objectifying women just because it seems like the most natural thing to do? Does my freedom lie in acting on moments of fury and being violent? Is it freedom when I do things to please my senses rather than attempting to resist them? What is this freedom thing? On one hand, we have people who want to be free by acting as per their desires. On the other extreme hand, we have the totally incomprehensible Eastern philosophy, which calls upon people to forsake all desires, and, err, \"free\" their souls. Immanuel Kant, one of the most demanding philosophers ever, distinguishes between senses - which he calls as pathological or derived from animal tendencies, and will-power - which he claims to be dictated by rationality. As per Kant, or my interpretation of Kant by reading people who have attempted to interpret Kant, real freedom is in being independent of the senses, but being bound by the dictates of rationality. He seems to imply that freedom itself is illusory, and we are either a slave of the sense, or a slave of rationality. Let's try science. Science has allowed man to defy, temporarily at least, the physical laws. Wright brothers, those geniuses, showed us that we can negotiate terms with the universal law of gravity. There is a beautiful scene in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, where Dagny Taggart rides in the engines of the Rio Norte line, having built the railway line defying multiple hurdles. I don't remember this accurately, but her feeling as she sees the seemingly-infinitely lengthy railway track cutting through vast expanse of land is that of pride at human ability to achieve. I can relate to the experience because I feel a mini-version of it often - whenever I take a plane journey, or ride a bike, and more recently, when I stand in front of humongous oil pipelines and instruments. But it is the very same science that tells us that what we call as reason is just a series of chemical interactions. It can be argued that we are just machines following defined set of rules, and there is no \"self\". Forget freedom. Hold on. You know the problem we are faced with? We are trying to decipher the meaning of freedom without having defined it. Of the multiple definitions of freedom in Oxford Dictionaries, here is one\nThe power of self-determination attributed to the will; the quality of being independent of fate or necessity. You see the problem? We dont know what the \"self\" is. We dont know if we have a \"will\". We will never be able to agree if there is a \"fate\", a charted path that we are just following. Each of these words has been discussed for thousands of years, and we do not have anything even close to an agreement. Language is full of confusing semantics, and \u0026nbsp;we will be going around in circles as long as we use improperly defined terms. Optimism is my favorite. Take a person A, who gets into a plane with a positive thought that his journey would be without an hitch. Take another person B, who gets into the very same plane expecting the plane to crash down. After a thoroughly turbulent journey, they both get down from the flight at their destinations, and we ask them about their journeys. \"It was terrible, man! Totally inconvenient\", says A; \"I survived, didn't I? So I guess the journey was great\", says B. Who is the optimist? \".. language is a trap, .. a dark evolutionary force has created language to limit human thought\", goes a line from the brilliant The Illicit Happiness of Others (I have noted down pages of brilliant lines from the brilliant book, with the hope that I will be able to use them to write about the book some day). Think about it, language is limiting, no? Words that define the most important things, words that provide a reason for millions of people around the World to live for, are ill-defined. Success, happiness, morals, virtue, optimism, freedom, choice; to name a few. So, here is my humble request to those nameless people who are concerned with such things. For the sake of the people of this World, oh wait! I am sounding like an average American citizen there, extrapolating my own view to that of the World. It is about me, and me alone. Let's try this another time, please. For the sake of me, oh wait! Darn it! It occurs to me that I am projecting myself as an unique person, someone who is always concerned about such things. Why do I think I am any better than any other person? I am just as average as the average Joe. Here is one last attempt. For the sake of a part of me, that gets busy on such lonely and unengaged evenings when I have absolutely nothing at all that I am willing to do, I request you to define these terms properly. After that, I will set out trying to form opinions about all these.

We dish out other people's opinions quickly, without even giving a thought about its merit. Thoughtcrime -- a term popularized by George Orwell's brilliant, ever-relevant and epic novel,\u0026nbsp;1984 -- is the occurrence of a socially unacceptable thought. But thought is never a crime. \"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it\", said Aristotle. At a time when human rights are of foremost concern in a lot of minds, and science is fast disproving almost everything about the Universe we had had faith in, I keep noticing a lot of liberal atheists who are vehement against any claims of God's existence, and resort to Science and logic to justify themselves. Their vehemence is understandable, for science has been subjugated by religion for decades with more earnestness and even violence. On one hand, we have scientists like Stephen Hawking who are willing to concede that science may be completely wrong, but we need to keep pursuing it for that is the best we can do. And on the other, there are scientists like Richard Dawkins, who are so sure of themselves and their theories. Dawkins is known for his outbursts against any one who is skeptical towards Science, or partial towards faith. How can you trust a senator who believes in flying fairies, he once asked on his Twitter feed. Just because someone chooses to believe a certain \"unscientific\" idea, do we start disregarding everything about them? As long as these ideas are not imposed on others, there is nothing wrong at all in entertaining a fantasy. I believe it is completely necessary to entertain all thoughts; regardless of their logical consistency, or lack of it. Even if a thought is disgusting, let us entertain it for a while, brood over it, debate on it without resorting to abuses, and delay our conclusions for as long as possible. \u0026nbsp;A popular advice for playing swing bowling in cricket is to spot the ball early, and play it late. Let us apply it to life too. Popular myth about life being short is wrong. Life is long and boring, and there is no hurry to conclude our debates. Now, place this idea in that part of the mind through which you form opinions whenever you visit my blog, and filter your judgments about me through this idea. To put it in a \u0026nbsp;nutshell, do not judge me by an extraordinarily disgusting idea that I might choose to hold occasionally for a while. Which brings us to the disgusting idea I am presently entertaining. Women are objects. Let me repeat. Women are objects. So are Men. After all, Science says so. Politics says so, for all Utilitarian Governments (and to my knowledge, all Governments are Utilitarian) assign a value for human life and base their decisions on it. All organizations assign a value to human life, and employees are referred to as \"resources\". We are all chemicals, no different from other matter surrounding us. Man is a complicated machine, and his emotions are just a product of the movement of dopamines through his neurons. Of course, my knowledge of the latest advancements in Science is limited at most, but there are a fair number of people who believe in this theory. So, where is the question of human rights? Why should we demand special rights over other objects? Now, let's say I have this precious jewel with me. If a jewel were to have emotions, it might desire to be flaunted around and receive admirable glances. But I don't do that everyday. On most days, I keep it in my house, lock the door and take the key with me when I go out. I don't even give consideration to the feelings of this piece of jewel by leaving my house door open and letting in some air. For firstly, I know the jewel does not have any real feelings; and secondly, the blame would completely rest on me if the jewel gets stolen. It is a pity, for I am neither legally bound nor morally bound to lock my door, and if someone does steal it, it is solely his own crime. I could probably protest that thieves need to be educated not to steal objects, instead of me being expected to lock the door. But I lock my doors. Every single time. Now, assume I am a woman in a male-dominated locality (in other words, any locality) in India. I could either dress conservatively and reduce the chance that I will be abused (unfortunately, dressing conservatively is not even half as fool-proof as locking your house doors, which itself is not fool-proof), or I could give in to my own feelings and need for freedom and dress as I wish. I am of course bound neither legally nor morally to dress a certain way, and anyone who abuses me is the one who needs to be educated. But, err, you get my point, don't you? Do not judge me, or abuse me. I have brooded over this thought long enough, and my contemplation usually leads me to my next, and last, idea. I happened to watch this\u0026nbsp;TedX Video\u0026nbsp;recently. A gentleman called Sam Harris reasons that Science can answer moral questions. The first time I saw this video, I was appalled due to a couple of reasons. At one point, he implies -- in an attempt at humour, perhaps -- that the motivation for suicide bombers is that they get \"72 virgins\" in an afterlife. A little googling told me that 72 virgin is a muslim concept, and Mr.Harris is subtly implying that all suicide bombers are Muslims. He then goes on to remark, and I quote Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No. (Laughter) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being? (Applause) This is what I meant when I started out. Just because someone is (probably) wrong about certain things, they are not wrong every single time. In fact, the whole statement, its premise and its conclusion is beyond me. I would have immediately dismissed this video as humbug. But I usually take time to look at the comments, with a view that people commenting on certain websites have a better grasp on logic than me. I realized that most people were appreciative of the speech, and decided to try again. To his credit, he explains that a human being is different from a rock. His reasoning is that human beings display scientifically proven feelings of happiness and suffering, unlike rocks. I don't agree with him though. After all, it is science that tells us that our feelings are merely chemical interactions. In what way are these chemical interactions any different from zillions of other chemical reactions around us? And if these chemical interactions are same, it leads me to conclude the way I have done above - Women (and Men) are objects. Which is why, I do not trust science to be able to answer moral questions on my behalf, for my own (warped?) logic leads me to uncomfortable conclusions. I often see online forums where pure logic is used to tear apart speculations, and Science is used to smother down imagination. A lot of people believe that Philosophy, which is more about the debate than the conclusion, should give way to Science. I may be old school, but I still think philosophy is quite relevant even today, especially in helping us solve moral and political questions. The Animatrix is a series of short animated movies that are based on the World of The Matrix Trilogy. In one such short movie called Beyond, a group of children discover an abandoned house where, due to programming bugs, the rules of The Matrix (which are manifested throughout Earth as the rules of science) do not apply. You can watch the very short movie here, and it does not require you to have watched the Matrix movies. I sometimes wish I could escape to such a place, where there are no rules, and we are limited only by our imagination.

Really. It is not an easy thing to explain, considering the fact that I am not sure how it works yet. All I know is that like a character out of Salman Rushdie novels, I can influence the World with my thoughts. I do not have enough evidence to prove this fact at the moment, but my preliminary investigations leave me with little doubt. Now do not panic, and do not worry about all those instances when you went offline the exact minute I pinged you, asking for your thoughts about my blog. I am not sort of the guy to hold grudges. On the other hand, I would be keeping note of all your acts of goodwill - including donating funds to keep this blog going, commenting on it frequently, sharing my posts, and reassuring me of the fact that this blog is outstanding. \u0026nbsp;I am, forgive me if I momentarily sound like Kamal Hassan, what most people would like God to be - someone who ignores your sins, but will keep track of your virtuous acts (even the pretentious ones). The first thing I will do once I am able to substantiate my claims about this superpower will be to train myself. I do not know the upper and lower limits of my psychokinetic abilities yet. Like the mutants in the initial few minutes of the movie X-Men First Class, I am causing a lot of unintended and off-target (but harmless) consequences through my power. I will be briefly mentioning about one of the many incidents that constitute my preliminary investigations on my superpower. You have every right to choose to believe me, or to not to. But with great power comes great responsibility, and I feel it is my responsibility here to remind you of the 17th century Mathematician and Physicist \u0026nbsp;Blaise Pascal. In case you were not aware, Pascal was an agnostic of sorts who was not sure of either the existence or the absence of God. He arrived at a conclusion by a reasoning popularly known as Pascal's wager. He started by drawing this quick decision table. God existsGod does not exist Believe in GodInfinite gain in heavenInsignificant loss Disbelieve in GodInfinite loss in hellInsignificant gain He then concluded that by believing in God, he would either have an infinite gain or a finite loss, whereas not believing in God would cause him either an infinite loss or a finite gain. Thus, Pascal became a theist. Having said that, I will let you brood for a while over the question of believing in my supernatural ability, and go on to describe one minor incident where the said ability was in action. A couple of months back, I sat down to write a blog post on the effect my name has had on my life. As it often happens, one thought led to another, and I was left thinking of this boy from our school. He was fondly called as \"Ram Ranveer\", but his actual name was Shree Ramalinga Alagiya Manavala Sundara Raja Rama Ranveer. He was from a neighboring class, and we would invite him over to our class when we were not engaged by any teachers to request him to recite his name. Many a Hindi periods were spent competing with my deskmate to see which of us can write his full name legibly in the shortest piece of paper. While I was busy penning the first two paragraphs of the blog post, little did I realize that through my extraordinary abilities, my thoughts were influencing a hapless and unsuspecting American journalist from Brazil to compose this New York Times article about some uncomfortably long names. To be frank, I creeped out a little, and reacted by deleting all traces of my article. In the two months since, I have pondered over this deeply and realized that there would be no harm in trying to rewrite the article. In fact, this whole exercise would serve as a beta test through which I will be fixing the minor bugs in my sorcery. So, here I am, attempting to reproduce the blog post I had started. My name is Adarsh. Once, at whatever age children do such things, I went to my parents and asked them the meaning of my name. They explained that my name is a Hindi word that means \"ideal\". I was a little confused, and had to seek the help of a dictionary to completely understand this. Here is what I found : Idle (Adj) : avoiding work; lazy This offended me a little. I mean how would you feel if you realise that someone had probably just glanced at you, and immediately concluded, rightly, that you would turn out to be a more of a sloth than a human being. But then, I asked myself, who am I to question my name? Names are not meant to be chosen, they are thrust upon us. Names are one's destiny. Names are one's identity. And to lead a successful life, one must live up his name. Having convinced myself thus, I set out to earnestly fulfill the meaning of my name and live up to it. It was only much later, when we had to study a chapter in our middle school Hindi text book called \u0026nbsp;\"आदर्श विद्यार्थि\" (The Ideal Student) did I actually realize my folly. Alas, it was too late by then to bring about such a drastic behavioral change in my life. I had to be careful here, and it took every bit of resourcefulness I have to finally figure a way out of this tricky situation. I elegantly overcame the problem by deciding that I would be the \"ideal idle\" person - one who is actually idle without drawing attention to the fact. Ever since then, I have always maintained a veneer of being hardworking chap, while actually continuing to be idle. If the meaning behind your name affects your inner identity, there are other ways by which names can impact you. The foremost of them is the school/college attendance. Ask anyone whose name starts with the letter \"A\", and they would dread the words \"attendance order\". Almost every thing in an Indian students life is done in attendance order. A guy named with letter \"S\" invariably completes his homeworks, assignements and record notebooks in the classroom - the lectures on responsibility, sincerity, commitment to learning and allied stuff experienced by the guys unfortunate enough to be named with an \"A\" acting as his background music. But what is life if not a set of small compromises, which you concede so that you get the bargaining power for the more important things? In fact, when I was informed that my name was supposed to have been spelt as Aadarsh if not for a clerical error on the part of the helpful guy who printed out my birth certificate, I took solace looking at what might have been. I got through all these little hurdles and finally started becoming used to my name. I even start loving it. I was so obsessed with my name that I went to Google to type in \"Adarsh is a\", and this is what I got : A lesser soul would have given up by now. But not me. If such embarrassments are arrows, I am a proud battle-scarred war veteran. Helped by my useful selective amnesia, I had no reasons to stop loving my name, and I still love it till date. That sound you get when you combine the letters r, s and h cannot be matched by the top-drawer compositions of Mozart. Unfortunately, not everyone feels the way you do about your name, and they invariably give you nicknames. I personally hate nicknames, and rarely address people by their nicknames. And why would people want to shorten a name that is just 6 characters and 2 syllables long? But like the popular pseudo-philosopher Ayn Rand states, A is A - in other words, what is, is. With a pinch of salt, I have learned to live with a few of my nicknames too. What I am going to do now is to describe a few of my nicknames. Before that, let me make it perfectly clear that I would advice you not to try this at home. It is a completely idiotic idea to lay down one's nicknames in a public domain, and make yourselves open to ridicule. But I am self-respecting person, and which self-respecting fellow follows his own advice? Didn't Groucho Marx say something like \"I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as the member\". So, here I am :\u0026nbsp; Maddu : Maddu means idiot. This one is reserved exclusively for my mother's use. Didn't someone say mothers know more than Google? Talking about which, ever since my younger brother was born, I was promoted to Doddu Maddu (the elder idiot) - something I am not sure if I can be proud of Adi : Another name used by my mother. Reminds me of a flop Tamil movie starring Vijay Ada : My cousins and a few of my uncles address me like this. Something I have got used to. Atheresh, Adaresh, Agash and related : The nicknames that irritate me the most. This was done often by lecturers who found it difficult to pronounce my name . My classmates would invariably laugh at me whenever this was done, as if the joke was on me. Idiots! NSNS : I have a difficult time convincing people about this one. But I distinctly remember being called as a Non-stop nonsense when I was a child. Though I have changed a bit, I live up to this name occasionally. My long-winded blog posts are proof enough. Silent Killer : A name that has been given by various people at various stages of my life. It comes from the fact that I rarely talk while with a group of people, unless it is for what is interpreted as a witty rejoinder. From NSNS, I grew up to be this.\u0026nbsp; Robot : This comes from the fact that I rarely react to things being told to me. Various people tried provoking my reactions by shouting out this name from a distance when I was with a large crowd, but gave up when I didn't react. Who was it who said \"one frames his/her own philosophies based on his way of life, but it is falsely thought to be the other way round\"? No one? Well let me say that then. One frames his/her own philosophies based on his way of life, but it is falsely thought to be the other way round. That explains why I am trying to be a stoic. Adar : It is the name that one of my current supervisors uses to address me. I personally don't fancy this shortened form which makes me feel like an expensive, ambitious and well-intentioned - but failed - project undertaken by the Indian Government to find a panacea for all problems. So, there it is. For now, I guess I will have to wait and keep an eye out for any ripple effect caused around the World by the extensive thought I put in to compose this post. Once any discernible effects are detected, I would file it with my preliminary investigations report, which among other things includes graphical descriptions on how I unintentionally influenced an Indian cricket World Cup victory not once, but twice, how I entered the dreams of someone to tell them something minutes before I told it to them in reality, how I made a miserly person buy an android phone by planting the idea deeply in his mind, and how I caused Russia to invade Ukraine. I might even write about a few of them here, or I might not. Meanwhile, I trust you to have made a good decision on whether to believe me.

I think, therefore I am. This is an oft quoted proposition laid down by the 17th century philosopher Rene Descartes. I suspect that if Descartes had had an inkling that a line he innocuously wrote down would be repeated around the World for more than three centuries after his death, he would have worded it differently, for I believe that the quote is often taken out of context and misinterpreted. I am no scholar of Philosophy, and I may be completely mistaken in my own interpretation, which comes more out of reading about Desecrates rather than reading Desecrates. Despite this possibility that I am completely wrong and misguided, I am \u0026nbsp;still going to give my two cents. After all, we are in the 21st century, and we are expected to embrace our true selves, and be confident, outgoing, spontaneous \u0026nbsp;and photogenic without being afraid of what others would think and all allied stuff (despite the fact that our true self may not be confident, outgoing, spontaneous or photogenic). Talking about pop culture, another in-thing today is living happily and in-the-present. You know, yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and all such things. It seems we are supposed to shun any worries of the future, and \"live the moment\" so that when we reflect upon our life in our deathbed (which is presumably in the future), we won't regret things we didn't do. Hold on, is there a contradiction in that? Ah! I am digressing again. Let me try and get back to the point. The common interpretation of Descartes's line is that one exists only when one is engaging the facilities of his mind. It is as if for a person to exist, he needs to contemplate over his life, over the Universe and over everything. I think, therefore I exist. Ergo, I probably do not exist if I do not think. In other words, people who can not, or do not think have meaningless lives, or worse, they do not exist at all. If only this were true, imagine how the things around us would be. Politicians, for one, would cease to exist. Post their 2014 election defeat, UPA's Rahul Gandhi (if he err.. exists) will claim that since politicians do not exist, elections are just a state of mind. Such a life would indeed seem desirable. But think of people who cannot reason, due to psychological reasons. Would you be okay with a proposition that people who cannot think do not exist at all? What about plants and other animals then? Do they not exist at all? The best place to try and comprehend the real meaning of what Descartes meant is here\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;at Wikipedia, or here at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. But I have lately come to realize that you people are busy and you have better things to do than going through vague Wikipedia entries about random people. Trust me, it is difficult for me to personally come to terms with the fact that people can be busy, that too in an Universe that will soon be explode into pieces of nothingness. It increases my already high inferiority complex. But I make efforts, and I realize that the only reason you are reading this despite being busy is to be nice to me, or that you are kidnapped and tied in front of a PC which has this post scrolling down at a font size of 30, and there are matchsticks in your eyes to hold them open, and knives on both sides of you necks to ensure that you don't turn away. In either case, now that you are here, let me try to explain my own understanding of Desecrates.\u0026nbsp; Desecrates was a rationalist. He was aware of the possibility that anything we see today at all could be unreal. I mean, look around you, can you be sure of anything at all? What if we are in the Matrix? It would take some three hundred years for the Wachowski brothers (who by now have converted to Wachowski siblings, or just Wachowskis) to make that unimaginably brilliant movie though, and skeptics of Descartes's time had to resort to the theory that the whole Universe\u0026nbsp;is a part of Satan's deception on the mind (one other theory I am aware of is by Plato, who suggested that we are bound facing a black wall in a cave, and what we see are the shadows of things that are occurring behind us. That sounds like you, the kidnapped reader, no? But Plato suggested that all we had to do was to untie ourselves and turn back to see the reality - for the want of a better word). In order to satisfy the skeptics of his age, Desecrates was ready to dismiss every piece of knowledge Man had, and wanted to start from the surest footing. This sure footing is his simple realization that he exists. His reasoning was that the very fact that he is thinking about his existence, and has doubts on it, confirms that there is a he. Hence, \"I think, therefore I am\". Even if the Satan was deceiving him to make him believe that everything around him is real, there needs to be a him that has to be deceived. Starting with this realization, that he is some sort of thinking thing with no essential forms (he was not ready to believe the things he sensed around him, as senses could deceive us into thinking about things that aren't. Think of mirages), he goes on to lay a whole foundation of knowledge. His exact statement was actually \"Dubito ergo cogito. Cogito ergo sum\" (I doubt, therefore I think. I think, therefore I exist) I believe the chief cause of this misunderstanding, which is hopefully not on my part, is due to the fact that we attempt to distill vast amounts of knowledge into a single cool-sounding sentence. Poor sentence, it has to carry the whole burden of everything Desecrates meant, including the context in which he meant them. There are cases when it is really useful to distill things into have such succinct statements. Seeing the spate of articles covering the 2014 Indian election scenario, I have decided to distill every single such article as either \"so, vote for Modi\", or \"so, don't vote for Modi\" and save myself a huge amount of time, which I would waste more usefully. But such philosophical statements loose their meaning when we attempt to summarize them. There are things people could learn from this blog post, which uses 1199 words (including this needless addendum whose only purpose of existence is to increase the word count of this post) to say decorated nothing. Reminds me of Oscar Wilde, who through one of his characters said \"I love talking about nothing, father. It is the only thing I know anything about.\" PS : It was cheap of me to joke about politicians. If only we common men had as much thinking ability as the politicians, things might be different. But why let facts come in the way of a good, or even a bad, joke.\nImage Source : http://www.chrismadden.co.uk/cartoon-gallery/philosophy-cartoon-cogito-ergo-sum-i-think-therefore-i-am/\n","date":"29 March 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2014/03/cogito-ergo-sum/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Cogito Ergo Sum","type":"posts"},{"content":" An Indian short story goes like this - a learned sage was once walking besides a riverbank, when he spotted a scorpion in the river struggling to come out of a strong current. The sage waded into the water and lifted the scorpion with care, intending to carry it ashore. As soon as he lifted it, the scorpion stung him. Gasping with pain, the sage dropped the scorpion in the river as a reflex action. He then smiled, and undeterred, tried to lift the scorpion again. The scorpion stung him once more, and he had to let go of the scorpion once again. But the sage ignored the pain caused by the stings, and kept trying to help the scorpion out from its predicament. A passer-by, who had stopped to watch the action and couldn't contain his curiosity after a point, confronted the sage thus - \"Learned seer, why do you keep trying to help the scorpion while it keeps hurting you?\". The sage smiled serenely (as wise\u0026nbsp;protagonists\u0026nbsp;usually do before stating a punch line), and replied \"The scorpion's dharma is to sting, and my dharma is to help the needy. Why should I deviate from my dharma, while the scorpion sticks to its dharma? One should perform his duties regardless of how others treat you for doing it.\" Saying so, he went back trying to help out the scorpion. Legend is not clear on\u0026nbsp;whether\u0026nbsp;the sage was eventually able to rescue the scorpion.\u0026nbsp;Nevertheless\u0026nbsp;I use\u0026nbsp;this\u0026nbsp;anecdote\u0026nbsp;often in defending my own otherwise inexplicable actions -\u0026nbsp;against questions like \"why do you stop when the light is red but when everyone else is ignoring it\", or \"why don't you go to the stage to dance when everyone else does?\". Hold on! If you have been reading my blog posts for a reasonable amount of time (bless you!!), and still think that I am consistent about my opinions, let me set you right here. \u0026nbsp;I might at times pretend to be more intellectual, more virtuous, more consistent and more many-other-things than an average human being, but I am just as unreliable as your average Joe. I twist, bend and ignore facts and\u0026nbsp;anecdotes, and replace them with other facts and anecdotes\u0026nbsp;to suit the point I am trying to make. Having said that, and considering that the aforementioned story does not fit in with the core idea of this blog post (Note to self added during first revision : The rest of the post doesn't fit in too), let me request the readers to forget it momentarily, and listen to another story - that of\u0026nbsp;Sisyphus. Per Greek mythology, Sisyphus was a mythological\u0026nbsp;king who was slowly turning quite\u0026nbsp;deceitful. To punish his misdeeds and arrogance, Zeus - the God of Justice -\u0026nbsp;sentenced\u0026nbsp;him to\u0026nbsp;serve an unique punishment.\u0026nbsp;Sisyphus\u0026nbsp;was given the task of rolling a boulder up a slanting hill. But as soon as he rolls it to the top, the boulder rolls back down the hill. This continues indefinitely, and legend has it that Sisyphus is still trying to get to boulder to the top of the hill.\u0026nbsp; Sysiphus Which brings me to the point, why do we obsess so much with so many mundane tasks in the World? The foremost of the mundane tasks I have in my mind is insisting on and trying to achieve cleanliness and orderliness (I can think of so many other mundane tasks. One day, I might try compiling a list of all the such activities, \"compiling lists\" being the first one in the list). Despite the second law of\u0026nbsp;Thermodynamics\u0026nbsp;concluding that the entropy \u0026nbsp;(or disorderliness) of the whole Universe keeps on increasing, some of us are quite obsessed with orderliness. I accept that some amount of cleanliness and orderliness is necessary in life. But why aim for a Howard Hughes level of cleanliness, while the whole World conspires to make things disorderly and dirty? Cleaning things is often a\u0026nbsp;Sisyphean\u0026nbsp;task, and let us keep it at a bare\u0026nbsp;minimum. You don't agree with me? Well, as always, I would (selectively of course) muster the support of an expert. Listen to what the American comedian and social critic George Carlin had to say on the subject of germs and personal hygiene. One more thing we waste time on is combing our hair. A research conducted at University of Liberia in 2009 concludes that an average male spends nearly 4 full years of his life setting his hair right (talking about which, another research conducted at the same University in 2011 concludes that 81.4 % of statistics stated in impromptu\u0026nbsp;debates and blog posts are made up on the fly, including this one). I personally like to follow a simple and effective philosophy of cutting my hair so short that it takes at least a month for the hair to grow lengthy enough that nature could make it recognizably unkempt, and promptly take another haircut. Which reminds me, it is time for another haircut.\nImage Source :\u0026nbsp;http://www.tabatatimes.com/say-yes-distress-albert-camus-myth-sisyphus ","date":"23 December 2013","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/entropy-and-orderliness/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Entropy and Orderliness","type":"posts"},{"content":" In the past few days, my assumption that the Earth stops rotating on its axis if I do not log into Twitter for a reasonable amount of time was shredded apart like a, like a, well, like a controversial tweet by Narendra Modi .\u0026nbsp;I logged into Twitter after quite a long time yesterday, to see if there is any netizen who missed my presence. Finding none, I diverted my mind by looking at the various twitter outrages that I had been unfortunate to miss. The one that caught my eye had to do with a Chennai-based Radio Jockey. If you know Tamil, you must have heard of RJ Balaji, or rather heard RJ Balaji. Known for his irreverent, humorous and often intelligent quips on everything under the Sun, he is one of the most famous RJs in the country (more so now). He is also known for his show titled \"120 rubayum\", where he discusses movies and the returns they give for his investment on the movie ticket. This show - which is very popular with his fans (who love it), and most of the film fraternity (who hate it) - usually involves RJ Balaji dishing out movies with enviable sarcasm and wit. Not for the first time, his review of a movie drew so much ire from the film fraternity that they allegedly threatened and forced him to completely shut-down the show. Having already revived from the show after stopping his reviews for similar reasons once, the RJ decided to end the show permanently this time - once again. Summing up the situation in a few tweets RJ Balaji announced made this announcement. Here are his exact words \"Ok here it goes. I am a normal guy who wants to do good wrk everyday n go home happy. I can't really handle the aftermath of evry show on films. After lot of thought, have decided not to speak bout films until there's tolerance and maturity among certain ppl from film fraternity. Which is most unlikely to happen, so 120 show is no more. Sorry to all those who liked it. Can't be dishonest to d work I do. I will rather stop talking bout films than to speak sugar coated pleasing lies. (sic)\" As a cliched cricket commentator would say, the situation was tailor-made for free-speech champions to make an entry. While it is always amusing to see these self-declared activists go gaga over some free speech issue (often in response to some poor guy who implied something he wasn't trying to. So much for HIS free speech), what stood out was the response of film critics themselves.\nHere is an article posted on a F.I.G.H.T C.L.U.B. I quote from the article :\n\"People are not always right in recognising good cinema which is why we need critics sometimes to point them in the right direction. We need someone to be the bad guy and say the truth out aloud that this film stinks, go watch the other one.\" Eh? Really? Don't people have the right to decide what they want and what they like? As a normal movie watcher, am I expected to like something simply because a critic says it is \"good\". How do you define good and bad movies? I have always been under the assumption that cinema is a personal journey, and every single person has something different to take out from every movie ever made. This is not the first time that the Indian movie critics' fraternity (if there is such a thing) has responded like this. My one-time favorite reviewer Sudish Kamath defended Kamal Hassan's Vishwaroopam thus. I quote from the article\u0026nbsp; \"When everyone is a critic, the art of criticism becomes even more significant. At the risk of sounding condescending/patronising, I must say here that the average Joe hasn’t been exposed to the basics of criticism or film studies. He reacts on an instinct, like a child getting his first injection saying: “I don’t like it. It was a bad experience.” The average Joe probably hasn’t understood why willing suspension of disbelief” is such an integral aspect of storytelling, an artistic licence that allows the filmmaker to tell stories that are larger than life. Which is why while he has every right to crap over everything he has paid to watch and troll anyone who does not agree with him, these shouldn’t be taken seriously for the same reason that critics shouldn’t be taken too seriously either. What you need to consider is the criticism – the arguments – why is it good or why is it bad.\" I don't think so. A movie is an instant experience. There are exceptions of course, I watched the Pulp Fiction, read about it, and had to re-watch again until I started falling in love with the movie. On the other hand, movies I watched as a child and liked instinctively like Ratchagan, Badshah, Thanga Magan, Siva, Dosth were among the best movies ever made in my opinion at that time, and though I laugh at the mindlessness of these movies today, I can't stop loving them. Any \"structure\" defined by a movie critic is arbitrary. A film, like any book written by Salman Rushdie, can break all these structural inhibitions, and still connect profoundly with the audience. Which brings me to the question, how relevant are professional movie critics today? I seriously believe Indian movie reviewers (even the non-professional ones) need to grow up (but for a few exceptions, like Baradwaj Rangan and Raja Sen). As a reviewer, simply dishing out movies just because they do not meet the artistic expectations of the critic is unacceptable. Some reviewers even go to the extent of judging fans of movies they don't like. What? You are a Salman Khan fan? You must be an idiot then. In their defense, a common argument thrown by critics is that since movies are made with a commercial intention, is should be open to criticism.\u0026nbsp; Absolutely. But there is an inherent inconsistency in this argument. The success of a movie is decided by the lay audience alone, and once they decide, there is no point in passing judgments. It is foolish to think that we are above the common audience. And when so called artistic movies released commercially flop at the box office, these critics blame the audience for not being mature enough. In a commercial environment, good products are bound to fail at times. Instead of blaming the consumers, market it well and try again. As critics, please decide if a movie is a piece of art or entertainment. If it is a piece of entertainment, it better entertain. If it is art, it is only for the elite. There is also a vague question of biased reviews. While critics claim that there is no way they can get rid of their biases, they can always try to reduce the effects of these biases. I can point to two specific instances by my most favorite (as of today) film critic, Rangan. In the first instance, reviewing Aadukalam (to declare my bias, it stars my favorite actor Dhanush), he mentions that letting two men go at each other like roosters is too literal, and is downright silly. In his review of Raavan, he misses the fact that Govinda (Karthick in the Tamil version) portraying the character of Hanuman is introduced as he skips between trees. In the second instance, I missed watching out the wonderful Vazhakku En 18/9 after reading one of Rangan's most caustic\u0026nbsp;reviews. His main point of contention against the movie is that it has no characters with gray shades - everyone from a city is bad and everyone from a village is good. The same holds true for Raavan too, where every single police office is evil-at-heart, while every single naxalite is good-at-heart. As movie audience, we need to be careful while interpreting the opinions of critics. While critics may help in getting a second opinion, the first opinion should always be ours. If we like a movie, we like it. There need not be any explanation or justification (the only useful purposes such justifications serve us non-critics are in helping us write blog posts and FB notes). Some movies are pieces of art, but the primary purpose of a movie is to entertain (be it at an visceral, visual, or intellectual level). Critics call a \"badly made\" entertaining movie a guilt pleasure. I wonder if there is any reason to be guilty about enjoying such a movie. Just to make it clear, I do not support the suppression of RJ Balaji's opinions, despite their causticity. I used to be a fan myself, until he generously reviewed Theeya Vella Seiyanum Kunaru, a movie in which he played a minor role. It is the response of film critics themselves that I am concerned with. If I were a movie director, and didn't like a reviewer's opinion of my movie, I would simply write a critique on the criticism, instead of forcing the reviewer to quit.\nPS : I tried conveying similar ideas in a previous blog post, and failed miserably in elucidating what I wanted to say. The responsibility rests with the readers of the blog (an endangered and soon-to-be extinct species) to understand it fully this time, and prevent another blog post from me with the same idea.

Meeting a little cousin of mine after a long time, I was trying to get her to talk to me. She ignored me and joined a gang of little children. I tried engaging all of them together, but the little children just mocked me and kept playing their own games. The adult crowd around me scorned at my inability to engage little children. I decided to give one last try. Approaching them, I drew out my flute-like mobile phone and declared \"who wants to play temple run?\". With those magical words, I had transformed myself into Pied Piper. As the children surrounded me with glee, one little brat climbed over my shoulder, and hugged me with an affectionate \"Anna!!\". Needless to say, he got the first chance to play. The children in Louisa May Alcott's brilliantly written Little Women (Volume 1) - a \"children's classic\" which laid untouched on my book-shelf for years until I picked it up on a severely insomniac night because I had few other choices - \u0026nbsp;are from the late 18th century, and I wonder how they would have grown out to be if they were to be born today. Margeret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Elizabeth (Beth), and Amy of the March family are the Little Women in this coming-of-age story. The March family is rich with happiness, but not too well-off financially. It is Christmas eve, and the girls are fretting over the fact that being poor, they need to work hard instead of having a good time like all the other children around. 'Marmee'\u0026nbsp;March overhears them, and reads out a letter from their Father (who is away serving at the army) which starts thus : \"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted..\" As soon as their mother finishes reading the letter, the girls realize that while their father is away serving for his country, they are being \"selfish\" in thinking of themselves, and vow to work as hard as they can. This is where I started getting a little uncomfortable about the book. It is just a personal belief, but I am not a big fan of sacrificing everything for the country. A collective morality is bound to become immoral at some point. And I didn't like the fact that these little children were made to feel guilty of wanting to play - after all that's what children are meant to do. I compelled myself to persevere a little more. It is Christmas day now, and Marmee March convinces the children to sacrifice a thing they had been dearly looking forward to. Their sacrifice does not go in vain though, as fate (or God) rewards them amply before the end of the very day. At this point, I was so disappointing with the book that I decided I would be better off trying my luck falling asleep. I discovered the next day - coincidentally (or through fate, or through God) - that Alcott's working title for The Little Women was \"The Pathetic Family\". The March family is indeed pathetic, pathetically good that is. A perfect Father who doesn't shirk at an opportunity to serve for his country, a mother who is a walking library of wisdom, and children who are adorable, intelligent, generous, hardworking and happy. In today's society, a similar family's ability to stick to such goodness would be challenged immensely. Probably Alcott realized this. Why else would she call them \"pathetic\"? With this thought, I decided to give the book another try. And I am glad that I went on to read the book. Alcott's writing is alluring. The narration is largely third person, but she surprises us by unexpectedly shifting to commentary at times (For example, \"As young readers like to know 'How people look', we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters\"). And there is a very subtle sense of humor permeating throughout. Each of the March sisters' character is well-delineated, and so are the supporting characters. Even the neighbor and close family-friend Laurence is almost the perfect boy that girls dream of (but he is not the macho type). The blurb of the book challenges us to pick one of the March girls to like the most, but it is pretty easy to make the choice. The tomboyish Joe (who is said to be an extension of the author herself) is the most likable of the lot, closely followed by Beth. Joe is completely unromantic, and her spontaneous burst on discovering the prospective romance of her sister is brilliant. \"..and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all!! They'll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to dodge..\" Admittedly, the author is a little severe while describing Amy (the youngest of the lot, and therefore the most \"selfish\").\u0026nbsp; The short book is sprinkled generously with some delightful moments. My personal favorite was the episode of \"Pickwick Club\", a \u0026nbsp;homage to Charles Dickens, where the girls publish a magnificent (and extremely witty) in-house (literally) newsletter. I really regretted that I had't done anything as exciting as a child. But the book is a little too preachy. Most chapters begin with the girls being a little lax about their work, and end with the girls learning a very useful lesson. Almost every single character is good-hearted, and the pinnacles of evil in the book are petty-jealousy, laziness, selfishness, anger and ambition. The book is a huge ball of goodness being thrust in your face like a cute smiling puppy, and challenges you to hate it. Also, Little Women sound like religious propaganda at times. A conspiracy theorist can point at Little Women as literature aimed at curtailing the ambitions of the poor. But I will give the benefit-of-doubt to Alcott. There are also instances which would repel modern feminists (\"Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands of fashionable accomplishments\") Despite its preachiness, Little Women works simply because Alcott's hold on writing. She makes us root for the characters though their little travails, and makes us feel their happiness when they come out unscathed (after learning a moral lesson or two). I would have loved this book without any reservations if I had read it as a child. Little Women would have been a book that inspired me to an extent that Uncle Tom's Cabin (an easy English version) did. But at this age, I realize that the whole morality of Little Women, though romantic, is not very true. Life is more like a movie directed by Coen Brothers, filled with absolutely random justice (the hero gets shot in an unrelated gun battle between two completely insignificant gangs, the villain gets hit by an out-of-place and unexpected car). I loved this book enough though, and I would recommend this book as a must read, for it is fun, enjoyable, and has its heart in its right place. As Loius Mary Alcott says in a low-key line somewhere towards the end, \"Now and then, in this workday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.\" Useless Aside :\u0026nbsp;Louisa May Alcott wrote a follow-up to this book titled Good Wives. For some strange reason, both the books published together as, again, Little Women. I discovered this in an unfortunate way when I tried to read some reviews of the first book, and ended up starring at some idiotic reviews giving away major spoilers from the second book. I hope that I haven't given away any such spoilers.

I finally got myself to do it, thanks to the \"Citizen Journalism\" section of the fantastic website Faking News. Here is a link to my article\u0026nbsp;at their site. For the sake of posterity and my own reference, I am pasting the entire text of the article below : Girl arrested for checking in from 29 countries while sitting at home The Tamil Nadu police has arrested 24-year old Soumya this morning following startling revelations that \u0026nbsp;she checked in from 29 countries in the last two years, all the while sitting at her home in Chennai. On contacting one of our sources in the Police force (who wishes to be unnamed), it was revealed that she is now held in an undisclosed high-security no-internet zone.\u0026nbsp; When asked how the girl fell under Police scrutiny, our source replied, “We were going through random Facebook profiles to arrest people who abuse the Government on the internet, while we came across this girl’s profile. We were stunned to know that she managed to visit \u0026nbsp;29 diverse countries in just two years. I mean, even our former President managed to visit only 22 countries, and the Honourable President took 5 years for that. We were sure that something was amiss”, continued our source, “And we started tracking the IP addresses of all her check-ins, only to realize that all check-ins were made from the same IP address.” “Initially we suspected a cyber-savvy criminal using sophisticated techniques to mask her original whereabouts, and we hired hacker Bharghava Rallapilli to help us crack the case”, revealed our source when probed further. “After 6 months of sustained effort, we uncovered the fact that all the 29 check-ins came from the same machine located at Chennai. We immediately proceeded to arrest her, but she has been very uncooperative, and has refused to answer to any of our questions.” Debashish Roy who studied with her in a popular engineering college in Tamil Nadu expressed his shock over the incident. “No man, I didn't know her personally. But I was always the first person to like her activity when she checked in from various places and uploaded picture albums. I had even envied her life. I mean, look at me! I got placed in an IT company and I have been sitting at the same place all these years. But she was supposedly visiting all these funnily named places! What? Did I ever think of asking her what she was doing at all these places? Dude, I didn't even care! I thought she was doing some MS or something.” Using tremendous journalistic presence of mind, our correspondent managed to get an exclusive interview with Soumya by offering her his internet-enabled mobile phone in exchange for her answering a few questions. “Once I completed engineering, I didn't get placed anywhere. I didn't even have money to do a MS”, declared the visibly emotional young girl. “So, I decided to join a Visual C#, .Net course at a local computer centre. But the only thing I learnt throughout the 6 month training was Adobe Photoshop. Being an optimistic person, I decided to use the skills I had learnt, and started uploading morphed photos of me in front of the Taj Mahal. Encouraged by the fact that I got more than 100 likes for each photo, I started uploading photos morphed photos of me from all around the World. I also started checking-in from various cafes just to maintain consistency”, she trailed on. “In my virtual World, I have already been chased by bulls in Spain, sky dived over Lake Wanaka in New Zealand, skied on the Andes Mountains, climbed over The Great Wall of China and trekked through the Amazon Rain Forest”, sighed Soumya. “I was about to complete my whole bucket-list, when I was caught”. Saying thus, she refused to answer further questions, grabbed the reporter’s mobile, and started checking-in from Lola’s, Cape Town. At the time this article was being written, the check-in activity had already garnered 77 likes. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi sent out an a strongly worded email statement condemning the “sorry state of affairs in the country”, and referring to the Government in third-person. When we pointed out to him that he was a part of the ruling party, we didn't receive any replies. In Bombay acclaimed director Madhur Bhandarkar announced in a press conference that he was so “deeply moved” by the story of the girl, that he would make it as the theme of his next movie. The as-of-now-untitled movie would focus on the struggles of engineering students, how they lose their identity, and how they lose their virtues when faced with utter-despair. To a question by a reporter from The Times of India on whether the move would have any love scenes, he quickly retorted with “Arey! Didn't I already tell you? The movie is about engineering graduates.” ","date":"7 September 2013","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/girl-arrested-for-checking-in-from-29-countries-while-sitting-at-home/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Girl arrested for checking in from 29 countries while sitting at home","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2013","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sarcasm/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sarcasm","type":"tags"},{"content":" A few days back, I got into an online debate with a random girl in a Facebook community. She had mentioned that this is the age of Science, and while Science is taking human life forward at an unimaginable pace, speculative Philosophers are just a hindrance to human progress. I replied with the speculation that a lot of what Science says could turn out to be wrong. \u0026nbsp;This started a fierce discussion that went on for quite long, and I was barely able to defend the powerful arguments she kept throwing at me, until the community admin removed the post for \"digression\". The takeaway from that experience was this : if she is right, Science is very close to finding an answer to The Life, The Universe and Everything in It, and that it would not be 42. Stephen Hawking's \"Black Holes and Baby Universes\u0026nbsp;and other essays\" published by Bantam Books is a collection of essays and speeches by Stephen Hawking during different times in his career, and like a cherry on top, it includes his 1992 interview with BBC Radio. Like the girl I got into an argument with, Stephen Hawking believes that we are very close to solving the puzzle of the Universe. He sets the tone in the introduction itself, with the words \"The scientific articles in this volume were written in the belief that the universe is governed by an order that we can perceive partially \u0026nbsp;now and that we may understand fully in the not-too-distant future. It may be that this hope is just a mirage; there may be no ultimate theory, and even if there is, we may not be able to find it. But it is surely better to strive for a complete understanding than to despair of the human mind.\" In the first two essays, \"Childhood\" and \"Oxford and Cambridge\", Hawking tells us briefly about the first few years of his life, and he makes it out as unremarkable. One feature of Hawking's writing throughout the book is that he maintains a largely impersonal tone, with an occasional sense of humour. This aloof attitude of his writing is further highlighted in his third essay (which is actually a speech transcript) - \"My Experience with ALS\". This speech transcript describing Stephen Hawking's unfortunate medical condition and its effect on him should arguably be the most attractive piece in the collection, given our morbid curiosity over other people's lives. But Hawking uses an unemotional tone, and describes the events alone. He concludes this speech making an effort to give all his listeners hope with the words \"I have had motor neurone disease for practically all my adult life. Yet it has not prevented me from having a very attractive family and being successful in my work. This is thanks to the help I have received from my wife, my children and a large number of other people and organizations. I have been lucky that my condition has progressed more slowly that is often the case. It shows that one need not lose hope.\" In the next two essays \"Public Attitudes Towards Science\" and \"A Brief History of A Brief \u0026nbsp;History\", Hawking explains his belief that the public should be aware of the latest advancements in Science, and his own effort in making this possible by writing his most famous book - \"A Brief History of Time\". \u0026nbsp;Hawking does not ignore the fact that though the book may be a best-seller, a lot of people use it to just adorn their bookshelves as a status symbol (The book lies untouched in my own bookshelf for about 7 years now. Note to self : Soon). Starting with the \u0026nbsp;speech transcript \"My Position\", where he temporarily lets go his composure and indulges in a self-confessed harsh attack on Philosophers (\"They are not in touch with the present frontier of Physics\"), the next few essays get into real Physics. Though I couldn't understand the Physics part completely, I could get the broad ideas pretty well. This is largely due the fact that owing to their independent by-themselves nature of the essays, Hawking gives a general idea of the same concepts multiple times throughout the collection. The final interview - \"Desert Island Discs : An Interview\" - is a delightful read. As a part of this very interesting show hosted at BBC Radio, the interviewer (Sue Lawley) manages to bring out different aspects to the very incidents that we encountered though Hawking's own words. For example, in answer to a question, Hawking explains the feeling of hopelessness on discovery of his medical condition better than he does in his own speech. A more musically inclined person than me would even take the chance to approve (or disapprove) of Hawking's taste in music. However my personal favorite in the whole collection is the essay titled \"Is Everything Determined?\", where armed with no emperical data to support him Hawking \u0026nbsp;himself indulges in what he accuses the Philosophers of being guilty of - speculation. Touching over concepts of a pre-determined destiny, and the moral culpability of human actions in a pre-destined Universe, Hawking lets himself go (with an ironic sense of humour). On the whole, \"Black Holes and Baby Universes and other essays\" is a very good read (at least for a scientifically non-inclined person like me). Hawking's writing is good and to the point, and his sense of mild humour ensures that all is not dull. Regardless of your agreement or disagreement (as in my case) with the statement from the book's Introduction I have quoted above, I would suggest that you go for this one.

Most of my content discovery has been through twitter. Given that I follow nearly 300 people on twitter, I come across articles of many different kinds. Since my the list of my browser bookmarks, and favorited tweets are continuously growing, I have decided to make a weekly digest of all the interesting links I come across the week, along with a short description of the article in each link. I do hope that it would be useful to you at some point of time, but I don't mind if it is not. Having said that, here is a list of articles that kept me engaged this week : 1) Here is the first one. A first person account of the sexual\u0026nbsp;harassment faced by an American woman who studied abroad in India. There is nothing uplifting about this article. It is a depressing read on the state of affairs prevalent in our country. A little time spent in the comments section of the article makes one even more depressed. When I shared this link in FB, I was directed to this\u0026nbsp;response to the article, which didn't convince me. But I would leave that to your own judgement. 2) Another related link, a super sad story (fiction or everyday-reality?) of an Indian born mother who experiences growing up as a woman in India, and is reluctant to come back to the country. 3) Meanwhile, my most favorite cricketer ever is back at what he has been recently best at. No, I don't mean batting in a test match to save a series. Here is Rahul Dravid speaking at For Cricket summit, reiterating the values of test cricket. He gives some interesting ideas on merging domestic structure of different countries, and scheduling matches based on prevailing conditions to preserve test cricket. At a convocation\u0026nbsp;function in BITS, he attempts to inspire youngsters with his own story. He mentions a particularly interesting plant - the Chinese Bamboo, which does not grow at all for 5 years, and then grows\u0026nbsp;up to 90 feet in the next 6 months. 4) Here is a\u0026nbsp;mash-up\u0026nbsp;trailer of the upcoming Tamil dark comedy Sutta Kadhai, where the voice over of the Tamil movie's trailer has been synced wonderfully with visuals from Django Unchained. Personally, this movie scores high on my expectation meter, and I hope it doesn't\u0026nbsp;disappoint. 5) And here is the link to a quora question \"What are the most profound quotes from the Calvin and Hobbes series?\". Need I say anything more?\u0026nbsp; 6) Sportskeeda has collected a list of the best Indian test cricket team ever from various cricket commentators and observers and compiled it to form the Best Indian Test xi. What stands out is that 3 players : Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid are present in every single list. 7) Apart from reading these various links, I also found time to engage in some twitter banter with\u0026nbsp;@opindia_revenge, the Indian wing of the hacker and activist group Anonymous. The discussion is on the merits of an anarchist state over a statist state. I decided to try using Storify for the first time in my life, and save the conversation for posterity. 8) While India was reeling over another gangrape incident, it was announced that Ben Affleck will be donning the role of Batman in the Man of Steel sequel. Indians joined the rest of the World in outraging over the merits (or the lack of it) of choosing him for the role. Having seen only two movies starring Ben Affleck (Goodwill Hunting and Argo), and I have nothing intelligent to offer to this debate. But here is a link showing how the Internet World reacted when Heath Ledger was chosen as The Joker.\u0026nbsp; 8) Here is the pick of the week. A wonderfully written unauthorized\u0026nbsp;biography\u0026nbsp;on Yahoo's current CEO Marissa Mayer, and how she might just change the company's fortune. Even though it is quite long, the article is informative and inspiring on so many levels. I wonder how the real people who have been mentioned in the story would feel when they read the article. If they do not feel that their personal space is violated, all journalism should be like this. 10) Frederik Forsyth is one of my more-liked authors, and I was delightfully surprised to find his\u0026nbsp;latest interview with The Hindu. For some reason, I felt very good reading the interview. 11) Roger Federer fans are having a tough time supporting their hero. Here is a longish article that considers the possibility of a comeback by the legend. The article maintains a balanced tone throughout. 12) And here is an story that touches upon the very reasons I dislike Science. The account of a social\u0026nbsp;psychologist\u0026nbsp;who fabricated data to become famous. It is also the story of a set-up that encourages such con men. And the story of a few brave souls who exposed him. A quick glance at the list, and I realise that it covers Current Affairs, Cricket, Kollywood, Hollywood, Tennis, Politics, Comics, Technology and Science. No wonder I believe that the Internet is awesome.

I have already read 17 books this year, and I am on the brink of completing the 18th. My aggregate for the whole of last year was 18 (The statistics are readily available, thanks to goodreads). I have also made a conscious effort towards reading a certain kind of books - books that I have been avoiding for a long time. Having read one book each by Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Franz Kafka this year, I can even try pretending to be an expert on existentialist philosophy. My sudden voraciousness in consuming books hungrily delights me, but it also makes me wonder about the reason behind it. One of the major reasons for my rekindled love for books is my new Kindle EInk. Buying a kindle is one decision I won't regret anytime soon, if at all. Having started my kindle journey with a sufficiently memorable book (The Fall by Albert Camus), I can't wait to get my hands on numerous other classics. But, there has been another equally important reason for this book-reading streak - depression. I seek books as a cure for depression, and ironically the kind of books that accentuate it. In a rare occasion where I get to show my work skills outside of it, I have charted out a flowchart that depicts a normal working day in my life.\u0026nbsp; The flowchart is quite easy to follow. In case you didn't know, the diamonds depict a decision point. The ratios in parenthesis indicate the probability of that event to occur. As I intended it to be fairly obvious when I started with the diagram (I am not sure how it has ended up), the normal pattern in my day is : Go to office, feel low over something, come back home, write a blog post (or get depressed over my inability to write one), try to promote the post, get depressed on the reaction, read a depressing book, fall asleep in a colossal ball of depression, wake up forgetting everything, repeat. Do I intend to do anything about this? No, not at all. I am getting used to this depressed state of mind. In fact, if I ever experience an exhilratingly happy moment, I might dearly miss my depression, and get depressed all over again.\nAh, looks like I have another blog post in hand!

The two headlines that scream at me when I take a quick glance at any national newspaper's website are : \"5 Indians soldiers killed in attack by Pakistan soldiers.\" and \"UP cops arrest dalit writer for Facebook post criticizing UP Government on Durga issue\". It makes me wonder about a couple of things.\u0026nbsp; 1) Security or liberty? Large Governments make us believe today that there must be some compromise on individual freedom so that the country's citizens can be safe. Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States, they have managed to prevent any other major terrorist incident. But as recent revelations show, they have also been monitoring potentially every activity made by their citizens online. The Government probably thinks it is a necessary compromise. What do you feel? Do you value security or liberty? Or are you Libertarian, and want minimum interference from Governments whatsoever? (As a side note, Libertarians believe that every Man has enough rational abilities to govern himself. These days, a lot of netizens proclaim themselves as libertarian, but a lot of them also accuse the masses for its tastes, such as in, and especially in, movies. This is a topic for a different day though) 2) Security at the cost of liberty? Liberty at the cost of security? As today's national headlines demonstrate, we seem to have neither in our country.

Before I could complete the post, I came across a random tweet that surmised everything I was attempting to say far more effectively than I could ever do. The tweet went like this.. \"I Don't Smoke . I Don't Do Drugs . I Don't Sleep Around...Because I'm Not Gonna Lose My Self Respect Just To 'fit in'.\" Isn't it amazing how people can stuff in so much wisdom within 140 characters? Thus having abandoned the idea of ineffectually repeating myself, I started to concentrate on more important things - such as movies. I pondered deeply and tried to define my taste in movies, which was admittedly puzzling. On one hand, I could see just a couple of scenes directed by Jafer Panehi and remark here is a work of a\u0026nbsp;genius, and on the other hand, I wouldn't think much of critically acclaimed movies such as Mouna Ragam, Nayagan or Avatar. On one hand, I would despise movies like 7am Arivu or Avengers for their complete lack of coherence and on the other hand I would be watching the Nagarjuna starrer Ratchagan or the Rajnikant starrer Baba for the 100th time, thoroughly enjoying them. I finally arrived at some sort of opinion sometime last week and started writing a convoluted blogpost about it, when I came across this Woody Allen interview. I strongly suggest that you read the full interview (and like me, get infected with his nihilism), but in case you do not have the time to go through it fully, I will quote Woody Allen's thoughts on art, which mirrors the opinion I myself have arrived at : I hate when art becomes a religion. I feel the opposite. When you start putting a higher value on works of art than people, you’re forfeiting your humanity. There’s a tendency to feel the artist has special privileges, and that anything’s okay if it’s in the service of art. I tried to get into that in Interiors. I always feel the artist is much too revered--—it’s not fair and it’s cruel. It’s a nice but fortuitous gift—like a nice voice or being left-handed. That you can create is a kind of nice accident. It happens to have high value in society, but it’s not as noble an attribute as courage. I find funny and silly the pompous kind of self-important talk about the artist who takes risks. Artistic risks are like show-business risks—laughable. Like casting against type, wow, what danger! Risks are where your life is on the line. The people who took risks against the Nazis or some of the Russian poets who stood up against the state—those people are courageous and brave, and that’s really an achievement. To be an artist is also an achievement, but you have to keep it in perspective. I’m not trying to undersell art. I think it’s valuable, but I think it’s overly revered. It is a valuable thing, but no more valuable than being a good schoolteacher, or being a good doctor. The problem is that being creative has glamour. People in the business end of film always say, I want to be a producer, but a creative producer. Or a woman I went to school with who said, Oh yes, I married this guy. He’s a plumber but he’s very creative. It’s very important for people to have that credential. Like if he wasn’t creative, he was less. Alan Light / Foter / CC BY In a short screenwriting workshop I attended at Chennai, acclaimed film academician K.Hariharan made an interesting point on whether film-making is an art. I parapharase him, \"art is something which you do using minimum tools. A painter uses a brush and paper to create art, a dancer uses his/her own body to create art, a singer uses his/her own voice to hold the attention of the audience. A filmaker, on the other hand, uses sophisticated tools manufactured by others, such as a Camera. Further, a film is usually a collaboration of multiple individuals. A film is a mixture of art, science and industrial process\". Of course I would be making a mistake if I categorically state that no movie is artistic. There is a separate auteur based genre of movies that are commandeered by a single person, and serve a sole purpose of being \"artistic\". I once tried watching the much renowned director Fellini's 81/2, and couldn't make head or tail out of it. A little research made me realise that it is indeed a film with layered themes, and the movie is a source of inspiration for so many modern directors. Such avant-garde movies do exist, and they are extremely important. But, All movies are not art and all filmmakers/actors are not artists. In the recent past, I have often seen people talk about how someone \"takes a whole movie industry forward\", or how a movie is \"ahead of time\", or how the standard of our movies \"should evolve with time\". Evolution is not getting better with time. When a popular Tamil director announced that his movie will be simultaneously released direct-to-home and in theaters, his fans immediately hailed him as a \u0026nbsp;lone warrior fighting to take the industry \"forward\". The very idea that his move was financially motivated was drowned in the ocean of praises showered on the director. As a side note, his movie has had a successful run in theaters, and is yet to release direct-to-home. Filmmakers are also praised if they are \"loyal\" to the industry and put the money they earn out of making movies back into the industry. Seriously, loyalty? I am afraid there are too many things to be loyal too these days. Country, state, city, area, the school/college you studied in, the subject you studied, the language you speak, the company you work for, so on and on. The only thing that deserves loyalty is other people. What kind of movies I really like then? I simply like movies that engage me, be it on a basal level, visual level, emotional level or intellectual level. I liked the movie Rashomon because it was gripping. I like Alfred Hitchcock's movies because they keep me rooted to my seat. I like Baba because Rajnikant is one of my most favorite actors. I like Attakathi because it is colorful. There is no thematic similarity in all these movies. They just appeal to me at some level. Let us not get others' opinions, be they of the masses or of the critics, to decide if we like a movie. We like it if we like it, we hate it if it repels us in some way. Let us not be ashamed of the movies we like. Let us not try to like movies that do not appeal to us, just because they are highly-rated. There are movie critics to do that.

Somewhere in the middle of the book, the story telling abilities of a minor character is described as follows :\u0026nbsp; \"..This was often the pattern of their conversations, Gholam choosing what they would talk about, launching into a story with gusto, roping Adel in, only to lose interest and leave both the story and Adel dangling\" I believe Khaled Hosseini must have completed writing this book, brutally self-appraised his own work, and then fit in this line that succinctly describes his writing style as far as And The Mountains Echoed is concerned. And The Mountains Echoed is written in a completely non-linear fashion, starting at Afghanistan in the 1940s, going back and forth in time and ending somewhere after 2010 (where a couple of important characters sit together and watch The Slumdog Millionaire), while traversing between Afghanistan, France, Greece and the USA.\u0026nbsp; The novel begins with a father narrating a story to his children Abdullah and Pari:\n\"So, then. You want a story and I will tell you one. But just this one. Don't either of you ask me for more....One story, then. Listen, both of you, listen well. And don't interrupt\".\u0026nbsp; And as Saboor starts narrating a magical story involving \"jinn s\" (genies) and \"div s\" (demons), we immediately sense that this story-inside-story is just a metaphor, and the metaphor is explained almost immediately. The book moves at a breakneck speed, until the narrative shifts to explain the back-story of a minor character. We are mildly irritated at this diversion, but invest ourselves with a completely new character, only to find that the narrative shifts again, to a different place and time. The narrative also takes different forms. While it is mostly third person, it shifts to first person at times, and epistolary at others. Having read a lot of other reviews, I realize that many people find this narrative distracting. Another thing a lot of people find discerning is that the book focuses too much on minor characters, and does not tell us enough about the lead characters. But this is exactly what makes me love this book, more than The Kiterunner and Thousand Splendid Suns (am I the only one to say so?). Almost every character has a back-story, which explains clearly the motive for their actions.\u0026nbsp;\nAnd this shifting narrative, isn't that what life is all about? We meet a lot of people, we love few and we hate few, and then we are forced to separate from them all and meet a completely new set of people. Our knowledge of others' lives is not complete, it is filled only with bits and pieces. Khaled Hosseni's writing is magical, and by the end of novel, any lingering doubt in his mastery of storytelling is swept away. I could relate to the emotions and actions of most characters - Abdullah, Pari, Nabi, Suleiman, Marcos, Thalia, Pari (no typo here), and my favorite Odie. No character is morally right or wrong - like the epigraph says,\u0026nbsp; “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right-doing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.”\".\u0026nbsp; On the flip side, I felt that a few characters like Gholam, Adel, Timur and Idris had enormous potential to be developed, but were left incomplete. There is a general opinion that this book is about sibling love. It is. But it is also about a galaxy of other human emotions. It is about a man who realises the true worth of his mom when he is 55 years old, it is about a woman who abandons her child to pursue her ambitions, it is about a girl\u0026nbsp;jealous\u0026nbsp;of her more beautiful sibling, it is about a man who almost dies at a place far away from home, lives on, and gives back to the society in his own way, it is about a man too lazy too do what he knows is right, and it is much more. I recommend this novel to everyone - this is a book you cannot hate (if your idea of good book is one that focuses on the story alone,and dispels all distractions, you might be mildly disappointed with this book. But still, you won't hate it, and you won't have wasted your time). And don't mind the narrative - like Nabi says\u0026nbsp; \"A story is like a moving train: no matter where you hop onboard, you are all bound to reach your destination sooner or later\" (My Goodreads reveiw of this book is available here)\u0026nbsp; ","date":"24 June 2013","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2013/06/and-mountains-echoed-review/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"And The Mountains Echoed - Review","type":"posts"},{"content":" The IPL is finally over. Just before the final match between CSK and MI began yesterday, twitter (atleast, my timeline) went berserk. Here is a glimpse of what the CSK fans were saying about Gurunath Meiyappan's (CSK Team Principal\u0026nbsp;enthusiast) arrest. Two recurring themes in many tweets were about the anti-south hatred of the north Indians, and how the Lalit Modis and the Sharad Pawars are not to fit to accuse N.Srinivasan, simply because they themselves are alleged to be corrupt. I chose to ignore the first one. Thinking about the second theme made me - as it often does when the mind is idle - wonder about certain things. Should we worry only about the accusations made by the incorruptible? Should we be more concerned about who is saying it that what is being said? As my mind wandered on, I inexplicably ended up thinking about the state of politics in India. I was reminded of a famous and much-retold Indian folk story. Here is my highly altered version of the story, which I believe sums up the situation elegantly. A middle class aam aadmi is walking through a jungle, using Google maps in his smartphone to find his way out, when he hears some commotion. He looks around, and finds a ruling party monkey and an opposition party monkey quarreling with each other vehemently. He immediately intervenes, and asks what the whole argument was about. The opposition party monkey says \"He must resign! He has just been linked to a 300 crore scam, and \u0026nbsp;the country demands that he must resign\". \u0026nbsp;The ruling party monkey lets out a laugh and replies \"Lol! Look who is talking. Their party was voted out of the last elections because he was involved in a 1,000 crore scam!\".\u0026nbsp; The Aam Aadmi looks perplexed, thinks deeply for a moment, turns towards both the monkeys and says \"Gentlemen, we have a serious problem here. When both of you are unequally corrupt, how can I be expected to judge your merits and demerits objectively?\". The ruling party monkey says, \"Sir, I have an idea. Let me rule for sometime, and once I somehow find a way to gain 700 crores more, we will both be equal. You can judge both of us properly, and let the best monkey rule.\" The Aam Aadmi excitedly drowns out the objections of the opposition party monkey, exclaims \"Great, please go ahead. Please ping me when you have amassed Rs 700 crores more\", and turns around. Not being someone prone to waste time, the Aam Aadmi busies himself in important matters such as checking out his tweets, uploading photos in Facebook, and forming detailed reviews of a recently released movie (which in his opinion was 'a complete waste of 120 bucks' ). After a few minutes, a temporary reduction in data speed makes him turn around, reminding him where he is. He looks at the ruling party monkey and asks if he is done. \"Almost sir! I have amassed 950 crores\", replies the ruling party monkey. \"What!\", exclaims the Aam Aadmi, \"I specifically told you to stop at 700 crores. You corrupt idiot! What shall I do now?\"\n\"Esteemed sir\", interjects the opposition party monkey, \"I have a suggestion - why don't you let me rule until I amass an amount of 250 crores, and then you can judge us equally?\". \"Wonderful idea!\", exclaims the Aam Aadmi, \"please go ahead. But don't forget to stop at 250 crores and inform me\". \u0026nbsp;Not being someone prone to waste time,the Aam Aadmi busies himself in important matters such as trolling the IPL teams of all other states, collecting information on the link-up between the blockbuster hero and the newbie heroine, and writing never-to-be-read blogposts (such as this one). A temporary reduction in data speed makes him turn around, making him remember where he is. He looks at the now-ruling-party monkey and shouts \"Stop! How much have you amassed?\". \"Not much sir, I have just reached 500 crores\", replies the now-ruling-party monkey. \"What!\", exclaims the Aam Aadmi, \"I specifically told you to stop at 250 crores. You corrupt idiot! What shall I do now?\" \u0026nbsp;\n\"Esteemed sir\", interjects the now-opposition party monkey.. (Loops until the treasury fund \u0026lt;= 0) (Note : In case my attempt at metaphor is so poor that you are still trying to remember the original story, here is it :\u0026nbsp;http://www.moralstories.org/the-monkey-and-cats/) ","date":"28 May 2013","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/two-mps-and-an-aam-aadmi---a-political-tale/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Two MPs and an Aam Aadmi - A Political tale","type":"posts"},{"content":" \"Kindness is a distemper which is soon cured by experience\" \u0026nbsp;- Abraham Miller\u0026nbsp; The\u0026nbsp;weather\u0026nbsp;that morning wasn't pleasant. It wasn't uncomfortable either, just unremarkable. As I wheeled out my bike out of my driveway, I wasn't as happy as this\u0026nbsp;person (yes, I am quite shameless). I wasn't sad too, just indifferent. Brushing a speck of imaginary dirt from my relatively newer shirt, I started my bike and headed towards my office. The first person I came across on the road was staring at my shirt. I immediately looked down. Was something wrong? Perhaps a couple of buttons were undone? Nothing seemed out-of-place. I readjusted my belt with my left hand and continued driving. When the eyes of the second person who crossed me lingered on me for a moment longer than necessary, I felt quite awkward. This time, I adjusted my rear-way mirror to focus on my shirt, but still couldn't find anything wrong. With a mild shrug, I rode on. I tried to put the thought out of my mind, but my eyes were unconsciously checking every passer-by to see if they found anything wrong with my atire. In another 10 minutes, I reached Medavakkam Main road. In case you haven't\u0026nbsp;traveled\u0026nbsp;by this road, it is a two lane road, one lane each for vehicles travelling on either side. There is no median-separator. I was going at a reasonable speed through a plain stretch of road and there were no other vehicles around except for a bus ambling on the opposite lane. A shabbily dressed aged man carrying a shoulder bag walking on the opposite lane did not attract my attention. At least not until he fell down flat on the road with a thump just as I crossed him. I had already crossed the spot where the man fell, and I had every reason to keep going.\u0026nbsp;Moreover, the man's appearance indicated that he was quite possibly poor.\u0026nbsp;Haven't we all been taught that a poor person falling on a road for no apparent reason at all is most probably drunk?\u0026nbsp;I mean, if he had been dressed like the\u0026nbsp;millionaire in the movie Pushpak, I might have immediately rushed to his assistance. His appearance made me hesitate. But I was reminded of a reader's editorial I had once come across on The Hindu (for those of you who aren't aware - \"The Hindu\" is an Indian \u0026nbsp;\"newspaper\" that has some news and a lot of opinions) which talks about the apathy of our society towards such incidents. The bus on the opposite lane braked cautiously, but no one seemed to get out of it. Not wanting to set a bad example by ignoring a person in need of help, I took a U-turn, stopped my bike and hesitantly went near the fallen man. Another motorist travelling in the same direction as I had stopped his bike, and came forward to help. I was still suspicious of the man lying on the ground, but both of us tried to lift him. He was heavier than expected, and my thin frame was not able to support him fully as he leaned on my shirt. By now, a third biker had appeared from somewhere, and he took over from me and moved the man away from the road. Momentarily left with nothing else to do, and spotting that the shoulder bag still lying on the road was probably blocking the bus, I moved it aside. Probably happy at being freed of the burden having to help someone, the bus driver rode on. As is the case in such situations, our first thought was to provide water to him. I asked the other two people, but like me, they didn't carry any water bottles with them. I ran to the only two houses in the vicinity, only to find that both of them were locked. Meanwhile, the man had regained partial consciousness, and was whispering something about not having eaten anything for the past two days. Having done little to help until then, I was about to suggest that each of us contribute around 10 to 20 rupees to the aged man, when I noticed that the biker who had arrived immediately after me had already drawn out his wallet. Before I could speak, he just took out a few bills marked Rs.100 and offered to the man, turned to me and asked me to flag an auto. An auto driver was curious enough to stop, and we bundled the tired man into the auto. By now, the shabbily dressed man had regained full consciousness. As we instructed the auto driver to take him to the nearest restaurant, the man who had drawn his wallet randomly took out some more currency notes and forced it into the auto driver's hands. Just as the auto started, the shabbily dressed man shouted \"Innum oru 50 ruba kudunga sami\". The man with the wallet glanced at us, and noticing that we were too slow to provide any suggestion, took out another note. The man in the auto happily took it as the auto left us. I turned with admiration at the man who had, without a moment's hesitation, acted so generously. He shrugged off my glances, and hurried away from the place. I could put myself in his shoes and imagine how he would have felt. He would have felt plain\u0026nbsp;uncertainty and an inability to decide if he had really been of help to someone in need, or had been duped. He would have wondered if he had been generous enough, or if he had been too generous. He would have pondered on why he wasn't feeling as happy, as one is supposed to going by popular opinions, after having performed a genuinely kind act. It is ironical that after having helped someone quite possibly in need, the first emotion that strikes us is self-doubt. Certainly, something is wrong. Either with us, or with a society that more often than not exploits \u0026nbsp;kindness, or with the people who teach the greatness of being kind. As I wheeled around my bike,\u0026nbsp;I wasn't as happy as\u0026nbsp;this\u0026nbsp;person (yes, I am shameless enough to pimp up that link twice). I wasn't sad too, just indifferent.\u0026nbsp;Brushing a speck of (not imaginary) dirt from my relatively newer shirt (where the poor man had leaned) , I started my bike and headed towards my office. Strangely, no one seemed to stare at my shirt anymore.

Firstly, he has this inimitable ability to pick a genre, study it thoroughly, and make a movie that stays completely faithful to the genre while simultaneously imparting his own uniqueness to it. For instance, his Pulp Fiction is just a collection of pulp storylines, but is presented through a revolutionary screenplay. In Kill Bill, which should have been just a martial arts fare, you learn the angst of a hit-women who has just discovered that she is pregnant, and wants to get away from her violent lifestyle. Secondly, there are the dialogues. There is probably no better dialogue writer around. And thirdly, there is his characterization. In a career that has had far lesser movies than his fans would like, Tarantino has produced numerous memorable characters. If you judge Django Unchained by these aspects, the movie is definitely a must watch. The basic plot line of Django is pretty much a part of everyday knowledge now - a black slave\u0026nbsp;separated\u0026nbsp;from his wife is on a quest to reunite with his wife - in a cow-boyish style. There are four pivotal characters in Django Unchained and since the the movie is completely driven by the characters, I would be attempting to describe them. Jamie Foxx plays the titular character - Django. Foxx has the tough job of portraying a black slave who feels oppressed by all whites around him and doubling up an adventurous cowboy, but he does a fairly neat job of it. Not every one gets an opportunity to stay in almost every frame of a Tarantino movie. In fact, only Uma Thurman has done it before. Foxx grabs the opportunity gleefully, and does everything right. He starts out as a helpless slave, portrays the delight of being freed (when Dr.Schlutz tells him \"And now Django, you may pick your character's costume\", \u0026nbsp;he replies with\u0026nbsp;incredulousness\u0026nbsp;\"You say you're gonna let me pick my own clothes?\"), and transforms to a bounty hunter and a man-on-a-mission. Unfortunately, the presence of three towering actors - Christopher Waltz, Leonardo DeCaprio and Samuel Jackson overshadows his performance. Samuel Jackson \u0026nbsp;has the shortest screen time of the four characters. He plays Stephen - the house slave ,an elevated \"nigger\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ferociously loyal to his boss Calvin Candie. As the man-in-charge of the house when his master is away, he treats the\u0026nbsp;other niggers as badly, if not worse, as the \"whites\" do. It is curious that such people of black the race who considered the whites to be superior did indeed exist (A parallel would be the people in Indian freedom struggle, who\u0026nbsp;genuinely felt that the British Empire was doing us good). \u0026nbsp;Steve's single purpose is to protect his master, come what may. When he feels that his master is letting off the \"niggers\" too lightly, he openly shows his outrage . Even when his master lets his guard down, Stephen maintains a hawk like vigil. \u0026nbsp;In a relatively short but important role, Samuel Jackson uses his bloodcurdling stares very impressively. Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and this. Tarantino and Samuel Jackson do make a wonderful pair. For the first time in his excellent acting career Leonardo DeCaprio plays a completely negative character, Calvin Candie. Calvin Candie is an excessively rich, spoilt plantation owner who entertains \u0026nbsp;himself by making his slaves combat until death. Quentin Tarantino has already given us two wonderful and unique villains. In Kill Bill, the titular character Bill attributes his deadly act of violence to momentary loss of temper, but he goes on to act reasonably throughout after committing this act of violence. In Inglorious Basterds, we have Col. Hans Landa,a villain who is deviously cunning and ruthless, but still makes it a point to be completely polite and charming. Calvin Candie too would go down this list of memorable Tarantino villains. Like Hans Landa, he has a charming persona that could be used to hide his ruthlessness. But unlike the Nazi, it takes only a little digging to expose Candie's real persona - that of a violent young man who is used to having his own way. He trusts his house slave Steve almost completely, but doesn't hesitate to point out who the master is when the need arises. Quentin Tarantino's asides where characters delve into seemingly unrelated, but extremely engrossing, topics of conversation are quite famous. Like Bill in Kill Bill series explaining why Superman is the best superhero ever, Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction reasoning out that dog meat is better than pig meat, Steve Buscemi \u0026nbsp;revealing his\u0026nbsp;reluctance\u0026nbsp;to tip waiters in Reservoir Dogs, Cristopher Waltz\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;in Inglorious Basterds\u0026nbsp;comparing Jews with rats, Calvin Candie makes an interesting observation on the relative sizes of various regions of the brain in Blacks that makes them subservient. The whole movie is a cowboy film, but for as long as Leonardo Decaprio occupies the screen, he manages to completely shift the genre. With his mischievous grin and apologetic shrugs, this is perhaps Decaprio's best performance till date. Undoubtedly, the best of the lot is Christopher Waltz, who plays Dr. King Schlutz (\"What kind of doctor?\", \"A dentist\"). Dr. Schlutz is a German born bounty hunter who strikes a mutually beneficial \"deal\" with Django. Christopher Waltz is probably one of the most talented actors around. Hearing him mouth Quentin Tarantino's dialogues is a pure bliss. Carrying on from where he left off in Inglorious Basterds, Waltz continues to be immensely polite. Taking his own good time to put his views across, he makes sure both the characters in the story and the audience give him their complete attention. Well read, charming and filled with liberal views, everyone (both on-screen and off it) will fall in love with Dr. Schlutz. In a movie that must have belonged to the central character Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Decaprio and \u0026nbsp; Christopher Waltz steal his thunder with their riveting confrontations. The master Tarantino has sketched the\u0026nbsp;characters\u0026nbsp;so well that only an\u0026nbsp;adamantly\u0026nbsp;evil Calvin Candie can force the genteel Dr. Schlutz to momentarily forget his manners. Django Unchained is not without its\u0026nbsp;flip sides\u0026nbsp; Coming\u0026nbsp;immediately\u0026nbsp;after the excellent Inglorious Basterds, comparisons are bound to be made between the two. Django does not match the very, very high standards Tarantino \u0026nbsp;has set for himself. The movie drags a little with a length of more than two and half hours. It is probably because Tarantino wanted to stay true to the genre. Having grown up watching Indian movies which broadly fall under only two categories - \"Commercial movies\" (which is a mix of every possible genre) and \"different movies\" - we may find Tarantino's attention to detail a little too elaborate. Tarantino has also adapted a fairly linear screenplay here (which is of course a rarity for him). Having said that, there are still some short and quick flashbacks ( a few of them, in my opinion, unnecessary). On the whole, if you want an enjoyable experience served in Tarantino's style, Django guarantees it for the most part. For someone who has never scene a Tarantino movie, this might \u0026nbsp;not be the right place to start.

You can always look back with fondness at moments that looked, and probably are, insignificant when they happened. Newspapers, websites, and uninteresting blogs use the immense marketing potential when a year ends, and review the mundane aspects of the year. I would like to claim, as I often tend to do, falsely, to be someone who does not jump a band-wagon. But when it comes to choosing between reason and keeping your blog alive, the latter usually triumphs.\u0026nbsp;Last year, I wrote a similar post\u0026nbsp;about the Tamil movies I liked the most. Regular readers of my blog (a species that is endangered, and soon to be extinct) have anxiously and eagerly emailed me asking for a similar post this year. I will diligently try to watch many movies I missed during the course of the year next week and attempt to write a similar post, but there are no guarantees. Until then, I would try to list out and briefly review the books I read this year. As my regular readers (refer above) would know what I mean by \"brief\", \u0026nbsp;I will not restrict this list to a single blog-post and extend it into a two part series. So, here goes 1) Freedom at Midnight (By Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre) As described in a previous blog post, I have always had an aversion to Hindi. Since I had to learn most of my social sciences in Hindi, the aversion translated to History and Geography too. I also read non-fiction very rarely. My reluctance to read a historical non-fiction was thus understandable. Having no other book to read, \u0026nbsp;I attempted to read Freedom at Midnight for the third time this February, and am glad that I did. Freedom at Midnight describes the Indian struggle for independence starting roughly a year before, and ending roughly a year after the day of independence itself. The thoroughly researched book is filled with numerous sub-stories. Despite being a historical novel, the narrative style is so good that the book, for most parts, is a page turner. On the flip side, the authors idolise Lord Mountbatten and Mahatma Gandhi. One also doubts the accuracy of sensibilities captured by people who played no part in, and were in no way affected by, the freedom struggle itself. But the writing style makes it thoroughly readable, and it inspires us to try and learn more about our own history. Verdict : I would thoroughly recommend this book to most people. Go read!!\n2) The Final Reckoning (by Sam Bourne) Glancing at the name of this book in my \"Books Read\" list, I had to wait for a full minute before I could remember what it was about. I am not sure if that reflects on the book itself, or my (well-established) poor memory. The novel is based on the second World War and a few hidden\u0026nbsp;revelations\u0026nbsp;of the holocaust. The writing is fantastic at times, but ordinary at others. It is a good read, if you are not put off by this inconsistency in writing style. Here is a link to the Goodreads review I wrote for this book. Verdict : Just a regular international conspiracy story. If you are looking for a fast-paced, relatively lighter read, this one is for you.\n3) The Namesake (by Jhumpa Lahiri) The title character in The Namesake is Gogol Ganguli. Born in the United States to a traditional Indian family settled there, and named after his father's favorite author (Nikolai Gogol), Gogol hates his Indian ancestry and his name. The novel depicts the identity crisis of Indians settled abroad, trying to adapt to a new culture while keeping their own culture alive. The story begins with the Bengali \u0026nbsp;parents, Ashok and Ashima. The characters of both the parents are wonderfully etched out, and their experiences are delightfully described. Ashok is well-educated and well-read, and adapts quickly to the\u0026nbsp;foreign\u0026nbsp;place. Ashima is more conservative, \u0026nbsp;and takes a lot of time to cope up with being separated from her family and friends. But when the need arises, she shows her independence and self-sufficience. It is in the\u0026nbsp;characterization\u0026nbsp;of Gogol himself that I personally felt let down. The plot falters while dealing with Gogol, and I didn't have much admiration left for him after completing the novel. Verdict : A could-have-been brilliant novel ends up being ordinary. Read it to draw your own opinions though, and let me know if you feel differently.\n4) Last Man on Tower (by Arvind Adiga) Let me declare at the outset that I haven't read this author's more famous \"The White Tiger\". I was lucky to get my hands on The Last Man on Tower, and was bowled over by Arvind Adiga's narrative prowess. The Last Man on Tower is set in Bombay, and is\u0026nbsp;centered\u0026nbsp;around a long-standing apartment complex named Visharam Society. Real estate developer Dharmen Shah provides the apartment owners with a very generous offer to relocate their houses, so that Visharam Society can be razed to make way for a high rise\u0026nbsp;luxury building. The money convinces everyone to agree to the offer, except a retired school teacher fondly known as \"Masterji\". Can Masterji, waging a lonely battle, stand up against the powerful Dharmen Shah? The Last Man in Tower is a classic tale of good vs evil, the power of money to corrupt vs the virtue of sticking to one's principles, with subtle but important twists. Dharmen Shah, a rags-to-riches man, will stop at nothing to fulfill his life long ambition. But Shah prefers to cunningly bring out the evil in other people than soil his hands. Masterji, on the other hand, is not a perfect embodiment of good. He is stubborn, proud and has numerous faults of his own, making him doubt his virtues. Caught in crossfire between these two men are a motley of interesting and wonderfully developed characters. The novel takes the form of a social commentary rather than passing moral judgements. With a detached air, Arvind Adiga just describes the society as it is, without taking sides. I am yet to read another book by Adiga, but I am already his fan. Verdict : A must read.\n5) Of Human Bondage (by Somerset Maugham) Each of us is a philosopher, and we all come up with a brand of philosophy that fits in closest with our own lives. \u0026nbsp;Of Human Bondage, a novel very close to my heart, is about the quest of a Dickensian boy - Phillip Carrey - to frame his own philosophical world view. Born with a mild disability and orphaned early, Phillip \u0026nbsp; grows up with his religious and narrow-minded uncle, and his unremarkable aunt. \u0026nbsp;As he grows into a young adult, he initially aims to be an artist. A little stint at Paris tells him that he is just a\u0026nbsp;mediocre\u0026nbsp;painter, and his chances of becoming a successful artist are dim. He bravely relies on reason over passion, and shifts his profession mid-way. Meanwhile, he gets fiercely attracted to Mildred, a woman who ignores him, insults him, and uses him. Despite all this, he overrules his reason and pursues his passion for Mildred.\u0026nbsp; Maugham ends the almost autobiographical story with Phillip realizing the pointlessness of the whole World. Life, he realizes is largely filled with pain, but one must enjoy the occasional flashes of happiness. Fittingly \u0026nbsp;the novel has a \"he lived unremarkably\u0026nbsp;ever after\" ending instead of a \"he lived happily ever after\" ending. The books touches upon quite a lot of questions I have wondered about, like the purposelessness of life, the pointlessness of love, the uselessness of reasoning against love, pursuit of passion and so on. There are also quite a few incidents in the book that I was able to relate to, like the\u0026nbsp;protagonist's\u0026nbsp;loss in faith, and the overpowering loneliness he faces at times. Verdict : A personal favorite. This one is a classic that you need not agree with, but you definitely need to read. 6) Rahul Dravid : Timeless Steel (Collection) Strictly a collector's edition for Rahul David's fans. This book is a collection of articles (mostly available online) written about Rahul Dravid.\nVerdict : Only for Dravid fans 7) Pet Sematary (by Stephen King) I have grown up hearing a lot about Stephen King's horror novels. I tried reading one of his novels five years back, but was unable to finish it. As a result, I had no expectation towards my second \u0026nbsp;attempt at being acquainted with his writing. Frankly, Pet Sematary spooked me (as it is intended to). Louis Creed, a physician, moves to a new house in a small town along with his wife, daughter and son. Settling down for an idyllic life, they find some chilling secrets held in the woods behind their house. Stephen King writes with a calculated detachment. The description of events become silly at times, but this silliness adds to the impact. Once the plot is set into motion, there is no respite from the tragedy the Creed family experience. Just like Lois Creed gets repeatedly attracted to the mystery in the woods despite his better judgement, I was unable to stop reading this book. By taking a seemingly silly storyline and making a full-blown horror tale, King shows us why he is considered as a master of this genre. Verdict : If you are a fan of horror genre, don't miss this.\n8)\u0026nbsp;The Negotiator (Frederick Forsyth) A standard Forsyth fare of international intrigue.\u0026nbsp;Forsyth doesn't loose his trademark detailing prowess.\u0026nbsp;Marketed as Forsyth's most unforgettable hero, Quinn - the negotiator, is introduced pretty late into the story, and the plot is gripping for a while. But halfway through, the story looses its tension. Reading his description of how USA and UK respond to a crisis, I wonder if such detailed crisis emergency response plans are made in India. But apart from the detailing, the book is relatively uninteresting. I can't remeber any other Forsyth book where a single central character is given so much importance, and probably this deviation from his usual style turned me off. Verdict : \u0026nbsp;Not upto Forsyth's usual class\n(To be continued) ","date":"25 December 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-books-that-defined-my-2012-part-1-of-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Books that defined my 2012 (Part 1 of 2)","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 November 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/interned-addiction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Interned Addiction","type":"tags"},{"content":" The first thing that struck him as he opened the door was the uncharacteristic\u0026nbsp;pleasantness of the weather.\u0026nbsp;A perfect start to a Saturday after the dampness of the previous day. He woke up a little later than he \u0026nbsp;had planned and had to hurry to make it up, leaving him without a chance to notice the weather until he stepped out of the house. As he locked the door he\u0026nbsp;realized\u0026nbsp;that he had subconsciously\u0026nbsp;broken into a song. He stopped himself , looked around quickly and let out sigh of relief after confirming that no one had heard him. Still cheerful, he pushed his bike out of his driveway. He had a long day ahead and later, he would thank himself for having found the time to gobble a few slices of the bread before leaving. *** He finally managed to break out of the traffic jam. He had always wondered on the fact that there seemed to be more people returning home on Fridays than any other day of the week. And add to it the festive atmosphere all around - why were so many people so happy on a Friday? It is almost like everyone in the World hates his job. Of course he looked forward to the weekend too. His roommate would not be home but still it will be a well needed break. He would probably watch a movie or two, and get a long pending haircut. He'd had dinner at his office canteen but the Friday atmosphere made him stop at a bakery near his house to treat himself. He was quite sure he would be too lazy to go out for breakfast the next morning, so he bought a loaf of bread and hastened home as it started to drizzle.\n*** He hated rains and was glad that it didn't rain today. The roads were still pretty wet, but he would enjoy his ride. As he eased on to a comfortable speed he caught himself singing again. This time he didn't stop himself. He\u0026nbsp;savored\u0026nbsp;riding in this weather. He was proud of the way his pair of legs and hands work in coordination to control and increase the speed as necessary. Sure, there were a million other people on the road who were as skillful as him - just look at the number of people riding bikes. But that doesn't take away anything from the amazing feeling. He loved riding his bike. *** He loved the internet.\u0026nbsp;Outside, it was raining pretty heavily now.\u0026nbsp;He was crouched over his laptop constantly refreshing various tabs on his browser to get instant updates. He had been sitting in the same position for the past two hours, and he couldn't think of anything that would remove him from his place for another few hours. As he refreshed another social networking site and\u0026nbsp;realized\u0026nbsp;that there were no new updates, he wondered if he could be spending his time more usefully and immediately brushed aside the thought. Shivering in discomfort, he instinctively covered his naked feet with a blanket to reduce the\u0026nbsp;chillness. *** It was becoming sultry now - the only sort of\u0026nbsp;weather\u0026nbsp;you would expect from this part of the country.\u0026nbsp;The sun was coming out and so were the vehicles. This city never has a holiday, he told himself. People constantly keep travelling from one place to another with no purpose at all. \u0026nbsp;He lifted the helmet visor to let in air. Wearing a helmet always involves a call between keeping out the dust and letting in the air, and the later usually wins. He gladly breathed in the relatively fresher air. *** He needed fresh air, and he needed it badly.\u0026nbsp;It had been months since he had even talked to his friends, let alone meet them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had spent the past few weekends slouched in the same fashion and there was no doubt in his mind now that he was getting addicted to the internet. Will it really be so difficult to be disconnected from the web, he asked himself. No, It shouldn't be. He used social networks just out of choice. He was just a passive user who was more interesting in watching the activities of his \"friends\" than announcing his own activities. In fact no one would miss his presence online if he inactivated his account at the very moment.\u0026nbsp;Outside, the rain had\u0026nbsp;considerably reduced. He could hear water drops trickling down from somewhere. ***\u0026nbsp; Like drops of coffee trickling out of a filter, motorbikes can find a way out of most traffic jams. However when half the width of the road is stagnated with water from the previous day's rains, even the shrewdest of drivers\u0026nbsp;are forced to wait in a logjam. A traffic jam on a water-logged road is a motorcyclist's nightmare. To add to it, it was\u0026nbsp;sweltering\u0026nbsp;hot now. He glanced at his watch. He was sweating profusely and suffocating within the helmet. He decided to remove his helmet, and loosened its straps when the bus ahead of him started moving slowly.\u0026nbsp;Immediately the car behind him beeped its horn loudly, forcing him to move forward. ***\nHis phone beeped and he glanced at the display. \"Harsha calling\". Another close friend he had been meaning to give a call for a long time, but had never summed up the strength to do so. Apprehensive of a a mild rebuke for being out-of-reach for so long, he pressed the Accept button and said \"Hi da!!\". As his friend greeted him back, he realised that nothing was amiss, and close friends can continue conversations they had years back as if they had been in touch every day. \u0026nbsp;Ending the call after an hour he\u0026nbsp;realized\u0026nbsp;that he had missed a lot in not remaining in touch with his friends. Harsha had called him to arrange a get-together the next day, and convinced him to join.\u0026nbsp;The rain outside had stopped, and his mind was easing out. *** The traffic eased out as he reached the highway. He increased his speed a little - he could still make it on time. It had really been long since he had met any of his friends, and he was quite excited at the thought. His mind drifted of to the last time they had met, when he noticed a water tanker ahead of him leaving a trail of water in its wake, which would soon evaporate due to the heat. He\u0026nbsp;realized\u0026nbsp;that he could not remember any of the vehicles he had noticed in the past few minutes, and that he had been riding mechanically. He forced himself to\u0026nbsp;concentrate\u0026nbsp;a little more on the present. *** He was quite sure that his lack of concentration was not a result of his addiction to the internet. He had always had trouble concentrating on the present, and as a result, poor observational skills. He rarely noticed the details in his surroundings. \u0026nbsp;\"Come on!\", he told himself, \"you can't blame everything on the internet\". But then, another part of his mind countered, he couldn't deny that his addiction had affected him. Only the extent to which it had affected him was debatable. There is only one way to know for sure, he decided. He would remain away from the internet for a month, and see how he fares. Before that, he would have to remove all the temptations to go online. He would start by deleting his Facebook account. He clicked on the \"Deactivate Account\" link in his browser page, to be greeted with a confirmation window. His cursor hovered over the confirm button, and hesitated.\n*** There was no time to hesitate, and it was an impulsive decision. Being just a few minutes away from his rendezvous, he was going at a fair speed, and was getting ready to overtake a dump truck passing on the left lane. The dump truck was carrying loose gravel, and just as he lined up with the rear end of the truck, a handful of stones fell out of the truck. The first flew straight to his helmet, through his open visor, and hit him hard on the chin. He exclaimed in pain, and noticed\u0026nbsp;that there were more stones flying towards him. He decided to brake, and as he braked hard, a SUV speeding behind him brushed his bike's rear. Thrown towards the ground, he felt his untidy hair fall over his forehead. His helmet was flying ahead of him, the straps he had loosened a few minutes before \u0026nbsp;flapping on the helmet's mass\u0026nbsp;rhythmically. He hit the ground full stretch, but the helmet was still revolving. He could see the visor now, dirty and scratched, the\u0026nbsp;scratches\u0026nbsp;combining by chance to form the first letter of his name. His bike was lying before him. Its MRF tyres covered in mud. He wondered at his ability to grasp in these details when he least needed them. He felt something wet flow over his spine. Someone was running towards him now, but he couldn't make out their features. His mind was starting to become hazy.\u0026nbsp;It was funny how time seemed to slow down at the most critical moments. He felt like a character out of a computer game. His mind drifted on. Computer game - computer - internet - Social Network. The events of last night played back in his mind. The rain, the dil pasand (or was it dil kush?), the depression, the call, the plan (would he be able to meet them now?), and his conviction to erase his online presence. As he recalled hovering over the delete button, he realized that he was in great pain. He couldn't move his legs, and he felt an immense urge to close his eyes. He forced himself to think back on the previous night. Did he click the button? Think, dammit! This is important. This could mean life or death!

If I ever write a SOP, it would never resemble this\u0026nbsp;(if you are going to read only one blog post today, I recommend you read the one that is linked). Admittedly, not many of us get to live a life that is movie-worthy. But, there are few moments in each of our lives that we remember for ever. I have described one such fond memory from my schooldays.\nIt was July 1999. I had just completed my 5th class, and our family had shifted from Thiruvanmiyur to Tambaram. Kendriya Vidyalayas work in a unique fashion (unique relative to other schools in the southern part). As soon as an academic year is over, students have an one-week vacation. Following this, the academic results are declared during the first week of April, and the next academic year is started. The summer vacation starts at around first week of May and extends for two months. Usually, a student can request transfer from one KV to another quite easily. Knowing this, we had shifted to our new house at the end of March. Unfortunately (fortunately from my perspective) my transfer got delayed, and I was asked to attend my old school at Adyar for the month of April alone. Since it was impossible to imagine a daily journey \u0026nbsp;of more than 40 kms, it was decided that I would simply bunk one month of school, and join my new school only after it reopens from the summer vacation. For someone who has always dreaded the prospect of going to school on a Monday, and has spent most of the time in his two years of professional career counting the number of days left to the next Friday, rejoining school after a three-month long vacation is never easy. And the very idea of a completely new environment had me totally scared. In the first few weeks in my new school, I had quite a few challenges. Most importantly, there was Hindi. I had a chronic fear of Hindi and Hindi teachers. As an example, in my 7th grade \u0026nbsp;I promptly replied to a Hindi sir's question of \"where is your holiday homework\" with a \"Tumkohi diya tha\" (I have give it to you only). He politely requested me to bend down, and smacked hard on my back for primarily two reasons - firstly because we are supposed to address elders as \"aap\" (the more respectful form of \"you\") and not \"tum\", and secondly because I had lied. To compound this innate fear of Hindi, my Hindi teacher was quite disciplinarian. She had a furious temper, and she spoke only in Hindi.\u0026nbsp;I don't remember every little detail of those nerve-wracking moments, but I somehow ended up sitting near this nice and friendly little guy \"V\". In retrospect, my perception of his niceness was probably increased by the fact that he was little - an inch shorter than me to be precise - and stood as the second person when arranged by \"height-order\" for the school assembly (I would be third). But seriously, V was quite nice. He gave me quite a few tips on how to handle my Hindi teacher. He even coached me with the exact Hindi sentence I should use to get my handwriting approved from her (\"Likavat teek hai, madam?\"). Then, there were the monthly tests. Since the syllabus for a whole month had been completed, we had our first monthly test as soon as school reopened. I was clueless about any of the subjects, but managed to scrap through a few of them. When it came to Hindi, I couldn't even make head or tail out of the syllabus. I turned to my by-now-close-friend V for assistance, and asked him to list out the chapters I had to study. He helpfully took my book, and marked the name of a single poem with his pencil. Having\u0026nbsp;diligently\u0026nbsp;studied the poem word-by-word, I entered the exam hall filled with a high amount of out-of-character-optimism, which was shattered when I glanced at the question paper. I realised that the poem I had so thoroughly studied was only a minor part of the syllabus. The result of the exam? Please refer to the image below.\nFinally, there were the seniors. Back then, \u0026nbsp;Kendriya Vidyalayas didn't believe in \"retaining\" students till 6th grade, and every student scraped through . Once we entered the 6th grade, we were made to face the \"harsh realities of the\u0026nbsp;competitive\u0026nbsp;World outside\", and a lot of students were forced to redo the year. As a result, we had quite a few 'Annas' in our class, who had to be talked to with deference. One of these Annas - let's call him \"A\" - happened to be the only person living anywhere near the vicinity of our house. In order to make-up for the one month I had lost, I had to borrow notes from A (which were almost always incomplete). On one such\u0026nbsp;occasion, I visited A's house to borrow notes. I met his Mother, who seemed quite\u0026nbsp;pleasant. Being a shy and reserved person, I was determined to strike a friendship with A, and willed myself to be at my extroverted best. However my best was not good enough, and it was time for me to leave without having conversed much. As I removed the side-stand of my BSA cycle, an inspiration struck me. I turned towards A, and asked him how much he had scored in his Hindi test. Even before he could react, his mother overheard me, and came rushing out, asking me if our marks had been distributed. Proud at my new-found-ability to strike conversations, I nodded my head, and voluntarily told her how much I had scored. \u0026nbsp;She consoled me (though I didn't need much consoling) explaining that I needed time to get used to the new environment, gave an affectionate glance towards her son (in retrospect, it could have been more of a furious frown), asking him how much he had scored. He replied without any trace of pride (understandable, as he hadn't scored as highly as I) that he got zero. Not wanting to over-exert my friendliness, I chose this moment to cheerfully wave them both a goodbye, and start home. Soon after I left, I heard a couple of noises - a slap and a shriek of pain. \u0026nbsp; The aftermath? For reasons unknown, I had to suffer some intense bullying from A for the next two years. Lessons learnt? More often than not, truth leads you into miseries. Honesty is not always the best policy.\u0026nbsp; ","date":"1 October 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-hindi-test/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Hindi Test","type":"posts"},{"content":" I spent this weekend watching and re-watching a Brazilian movie titled Abril Despedacado (literally\u0026nbsp;translating\u0026nbsp;to Broken April), which was released in English as Behind the Sun. The movie is directed by Walter Salles, who has also directed the wonderful Motorcycle Diaries. I have been so touched by the movie, that I decided to write about it. The movie starts with a young boy, who introduces himself as Pacu. He goes on to explain that it is a brand new name, to which he is yet to get used to. Pacu is trying to remember a story, but it gets mixed up with another story - one involving the boy, his elder brother Tonio, and a blood-stained shirt tied to the wind. Cut into flashback, we are introduced to the poverty ridden Breves family - the father who is a taskmaster, the mother who just gives in to her husband's wishes, and their two sons. The Breves make their living by farming sugarcanes and extracting sugar. Later in the movie, the father says to his wife that after loosing everything, the only thing they have left is honour. And what form does this honour take? Years earlier, we learn, the Breves got into a feudal fight with another family, the Ferreiras. The fight carried on for generations, leading to Pacu and Tonio's elder brother being killed. Now, it is upon Tonio to protect the honour of his family by avenging his elder brother's death. Meanwhile, Pacu gets acquainted with, and introduces Tonio to the vagrant circus artists Salustiano and Clara. Tonio is enticed by the\u0026nbsp;beautiful\u0026nbsp;Clara. Does he protect the \"honor\" of his family, or does he get\u0026nbsp;victimized\u0026nbsp;in the family feud? Does he stick to the family tradition despite knowing the futility of it all, or does he go on a quest for a better life? Will the bloody saga of family\u0026nbsp;vengeance\u0026nbsp;be resolved? And, what has Pacu got to do with this all? Reading my sludgy attempt to describe the plot line, you must be imagining a gory and violent movie. The movie is anything but gory.\u0026nbsp;It is, to the contrary, poetic,\u0026nbsp;picturesque, and heavily laden with lovely metaphors.\u0026nbsp;I have listed just a few here, taking care not to have any spoilers. The Breves family crush sugarcane in a mill that is pulled by a couple of Oxen, which go round and round. Pacu points out that they are like the oxen, going round and round all day, but never going anyway. This is a remark at all of us, who are afraid to break out of our routines. Pacu is presented with a book by Clara. She asks him if he can read. \"No\", he says, \"but I can read the pictures\". He then goes on to make his own story from the pictures. This signifies the creativity of the little kid, his ability to use his imaginations to escape the dreariness of everyday routine, and the need for escapism Of the two brothers, the younger Pacu is more imaginative, and more dissident to the traditions. The older Tonio recognizes the futility of the family feud, but is too reluctant to disobey his father. Pacu's favorite hangout is a swing, which symbolyses freedom from their dreary routine. In a decisive point in the screenplay, Tonio is shown to be sitting on the swing. He tells to his younger brother \"I thought you how to fly with this, remember? You were scared shitless\". \"Tonio\", replies the kid brother, \"today, it's your turn. You take my place, and I will take yours\". \"No, I don't want to\" says the older brother, but is urged on by the younger one. What follows is a wonderful scene of brotherly love. This \u0026nbsp;conversation also signifies the role-reversal between the bothers. In a direct metaphor,\u0026nbsp; Salustiano\u0026nbsp;compares the\u0026nbsp;feuding family to a couple of snakes he had seen fighting. \"Each was biting the tail of the other. They ate each other up until nothing was left. Nothing but a pool of blood on the ground.\"\u0026nbsp; Apart from the\u0026nbsp;symbolisms, the movie has quite a few scenes of pure cinematic beauty. The whole experience takes you to a different time and space, and the stunning climax leaves an impact for a long time after the movie ends. If you have some time to spare, I urge you to watch this one. In case you are not yet fully convinced, here is the movie trailer.

The estimated cost of the mission will be Rs. 450 crore, and chances are that the real cost will be much higher. ISRO's ex-chief, Padma Vibushan Madhavan Nair believes that such a mission to Mars might not really achieve something. Apart from him, quite a few voices in India feel that the money could be spent in a more useful way. Others, a second and a larger group, have applauded the initiative by ISRO, and are looking forward to the November 2013 launch with eagerness. Money spent on scientific pursuits, they argue, always pay rich dividends. Rs.450 Crore, they calculate, is roughly 40% of the money lost in the 2G scam. Even if the money is not spent in research, they reason, it is highly probable that the money would land up in another corrupt minister's personal account. And after all, they assure us, the pursuit of knowledge must be one's ultimate aim in life. If you tentatively ask them what if the mission failed, they would \u0026nbsp; probably quote the names of numerous great minds, who crossed the hurdle of fear of failure, and ultimately led humankind to significant truths. Just for argument's sake, as I explained my liberty to do so in my previous blog post , I am going to consider \u0026nbsp;two sets of queries : What if real truth is undesirable? Is\u0026nbsp;suffering, like Nihilists and a few others claim, the real purpose of life? Even otherwise, if there are times in a Man's life when he suffers, is he morally bound to face it, or is it permissible for him to attempt an escape into an alternate reality? What if real truth is\u0026nbsp;unpercievable? What if the real truths are beyond us? What if certain things are not meant to be understood? How important is pursuit of knowledge? Are all spheres of knowledge equally important? For the first set of queries, I have listed a few situations from popular movies where truth is indeed undesirable. Life is Beautiful A strange title, one would say, in a post that is supposed to touch upon the the possibility that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. But, I am trying to draw your attention to the wonderful movie with the same name \u0026nbsp;directed by Robert Benigni. In an unlikely case that you haven't seen this movie, I advise you to see it as soon as possible. Here is the plot of the movie in short : Guido Orefice (Robert Benigni) is an Italian Jew blessed with immense wit and humour. He charms a schoolteacher, Dora, and they both get married. Leading a perfectly happy life, they proudly watch their son - Giosue - grow into a 5-year old, until they face the horrific political situation around them. They are arrested by Nazis for being Jews, and sent to a concentration camp. Orefice makes his son believe that they are on a holiday, playing a complicated game. He takes immense risks to convince his son that they have a good chance of winning the game, if only the boy follows a certain set of \"rules\". Throughout their time at the concentration camp, Orefice suffers, but protects his son from the brutal truth. The movie ends with a grown up Giosue (who narrates the whole story in flashback) saying \"This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This is his gift to me.\" I have talked to quite a few people about the movie, and they unanimously agree with me that it is one the the best movies ever. But, just extending the story a little bit, I wonder how the son must have felt growing up. Would he be eternally grateful to his father for not letting him suffer, or would he feel guilty for living a life of a lie, for being immersed in his own imagination when the most horrific crime in humanity was being committed, for being happy when his father suffered. The son would even be justified in feeling a little angry at his father \u0026nbsp;for not trusting him to handle the truth, for betraying him. What do you think? Was the father right in constructing an elaborate alternate reality just to protect his son's mind? Is truth, at least at times, \u0026nbsp;so undesirable? Cristopher Nolan and Escapism \"Sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more\" \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;-Batman, in The Dark Knight For a movie-maker, it is extremely difficult to get the approvals of both the popular public and the hard-to-satisfy movie critics. Cristopher Nolan has undoubtedly achieved this symbol of greatness. But how realistic are Cristopher Nolan's movies? Read this wonderful profile\u0026nbsp;of the director to know more about Cristopher Nolan's own brand of escapism. Escapism is roughly defined as the avoidance of reality by absorption of mind in entertainment or other imaginary situations, and an escape from the banalities and\u0026nbsp;unpleasantness\u0026nbsp;of everyday life. The wonderful article explains Nolan's moviemaking with enough examples, but I\u0026nbsp;would\u0026nbsp;like talk about a scene from Dark Knight Rises (No spoilers. Nothing you couldn't make out from the trailers anyway). Gotham is under a bomb threat, and it seems like nothing can save them. Detective Blake tries to lead a bus full of children out of the city, but he is stopped. Still stranded inside the city, and noticing that the there are only a few seconds before the bomb will explode, he urges all the children to get inside the bus. The bus driver, already reconciled with his\u0026nbsp;perceived\u0026nbsp;fate, asks\u0026nbsp;(Sorry if the quotes are inaccurate, I am repeating it from my unreliable memory)\u0026nbsp;\"Seriously? Do you think the bus will protect them from the explosion?\". Blake replies with a question of his own \"Would you let them all die without even a hope for survival?\". Would you? Is hope so important that truth can take a backseat? I would say not always, but at least at times. An over-used, but true description that suits most movies is that they are a \"willing suspension of disbelief\". If truth is extremely important, why are so many popular movies escapist? \"Ignorance is a Bliss\" Whenever I hear this quote, I am invariably reminded of The Matrix, and the character of Cypher. Cypher is the character who strikes a deal with The Agents -he would lay a trap for Morpheus in return for being sent back to The Matrix as a rich and powerful man, with no memories of the \"truth\". Cypher is a perfect example that there are quite a few people who would like to escape reality, if it is full of suffering. As you can see, all these instances consist of people living life filled with perceived\u0026nbsp;or real suffering, and choosing to escape it. A few people may oppose with this way of dealing with life. They claim that the truth must be faced - regardless of its nature. Others may claim that each person can make a choice, like choosing between Morpheus' red and blue pills. To make this choice, however, complete knowledge is essential. The Pursuit of Knowledge Rationalists are people who believe in human senses - they believe that the answer to all questions on life can be eventually arrived at. \u0026nbsp;There are quite a few sets of people who do not agree with this chain of thought. Even Plato is said to have believed that what we sense and see is not essentially the reality. For the moment, let's assume that the rationalists are right. Can we still understand the complete laws of nature within the lifetime of humanity as a whole? There are numerous specializations in Science today, and numerous unanswered questions in each of them. Is the query \" why are women more/less prone to texting during office hours\" (I can be pretty sure that a team of researchers in some part of the World are trying to deduce this) as important as finding a cure to, say, \u0026nbsp;the common cold? If knowledge is power, is more knowledge essentially more power? I would rather say that more essential knowledge is more power. I have nothing against ISRO's\u0026nbsp;satellite\u0026nbsp;launch, and I wish ISRO all the best. But, personally, I would like to see some one prioritize the most important avenues of research, and ensuring that we have the right questions before seeking the answers. This would save a lot of resource and money.

I am sucker for good\u0026nbsp;arguments, and will completely agree with anyone's opinion, as long as it has a shred of logic in it. For instance, reading Ayn Rand's wonderful portrait of Howard Roark and John Galt, I remember thinking that the pursuit of one's own\u0026nbsp;happiness must indeed be the purpose of Man's life. This view was shortly reversed by reading (only\u0026nbsp;partially) Fyoder Dostoyevskey's The Idiot, whose\u0026nbsp;protagonist\u0026nbsp;Prince Myshkin is the very definition of saintliness. A character diametrically opposite to John Galt, he attracted my sympathy towards himself, and his way of life. My latest views on life have been shaped by reading Somerset Maugham's semi-autobiographical novel On Human Bondage , which I believe (probably wrongly), derives its philosophy from Spinoza and Schopenhauer. I have little doubt that my views -\u0026nbsp;to paraphrase\u0026nbsp;Douglas Adams -\u0026nbsp;on the answer to The Life, The Universe and Everything will be influenced by the next well-written book I read. I find even Ram Gopal Varma's views on life (follow his infamous twitter account @RGVzoomin to get a first-hand experience) brilliant at times.\u0026nbsp; Should this indecisiveness on opinions worry me? \u0026nbsp;I don't think so. Like Phillip Carrey of On Human Bondage who toys with a myriad ideas - both on philosophy and his career, before zeroing on his own brand of philosophy (and a suitable career), I am ready to take ample time on shaping my opinions. It is also my belief that a World filled with people having only extreme opinions will be boring at best, and catastrophic at worst. Moderates are essential for civilization. So, I may write about the benifits of democracy when the World goes gaga over China's achievements in\u0026nbsp;Olympics, and the\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;necessities\u0026nbsp;of an\u0026nbsp;authoritarian\u0026nbsp;Government when the country aims its guns at Kapil Sibal. I might write about the importance of pessimism (which I firmly believe in) today, only to write on the uplifting qualities of a Wodehouse novel tomorrow. In short, I would try to play a minor - often insignificant - role in buffering the public opinions.\u0026nbsp; In case you have survived reading the first two paragraphs, and you are still not wondering about the purpose of life and other such metaphysical questions, you must atleast be wondering about the purpose of this post. I am writing this just as a disclaimer to all further posts, and this whole blog in general. When freedom to have an opinion, and to express it is recognized in a large part of the World (and is used, and even exploited by every Joe in the internet), I also reserve the right to alter, or even reverse my opinions. For\u0026nbsp;argument's\u0026nbsp;sake, I will write blog posts on opinions I may not agree with, and highlight their merits. It is just a personal exercise, something that you might find as a self-indulgence. But, I intend to carry on with it. Any help that you can give in the form of discussions will be accepted gratefully.\u0026nbsp; Finally, in a tribute to my essay writing school-days, I have begin and ended this post with a quote. I once again draw the assistance of Douglas Adams, who succinctly\u0026nbsp;sums up my dilemma in maintaining a blog. \"The history of The Hitchhiker's guide to Galaxy is now so complicated that every time I tell it I contradict myself, and whenever I do get it right, I am misquoted\" \u0026nbsp;- Douglas Adams ","date":"5 August 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-importance-of-being-fickle-minded/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Importance of being Fickle-Minded","type":"posts"},{"content":" There have been lots of posts going around in Facebook recently claiming that we, those of us who are in our twenties at this point of time, are the luckiest generation ever. the posts reason that we have had the best of most things, and we have seen a lot in our short lifetime already. I had mentioned in a previous\u0026nbsp;post\u0026nbsp;that every generation probably thinks it is the best to ever have set foot on this planet. But, the circulating status messages may have an iota of truth to them, considering that we have seen the advent and demise of many things in our short lifetime. I remember a time when the house at my native place Trichy was the only one I knew with a landline connection, and I still remember the phone number. We have come a long way since then, especially in electronics. When I see the variety and detail in video games today, I never cease to be amazed. Though not an ardent gamer, I do try my hand at a few of them at times. Whenever I do, I get a feeling that even though the games I grew up playing had much poorer graphics, they were better in many ways. Gamers of today might disagree with me, but for someone who often gets satisfied by the simpler things in life, the games of the yore were more charming and addictive. I have listed 10 games that I found most addictive as I grew up, and I still find them so. Most of these games had a very simple concept, but still managed to engage us for hours. 1)\u0026nbsp;Brick Video Game - Cars I apologise for the not-so-catchy-sounding title, but if you stretch your memory a litttle, you will remember that hand-held games we grew up with did not have names. They had numbers, and in my own device, the car games were numbered B1 to B4. The concept was simple. You are riding a car in what can be imagined as a two lane highway. The only aim of the game is that you should not crash with the cars coming in the oppsite direction. Yet, this game was completely engrossing. I remember starting with level 1, where the car would move slowly, and the speed would get increased as we gather more speed. In case I stirred your nostalgia a little, have a look at this video.\u0026nbsp; 2) Super Mario I am sure this is up high on everyone's list. I won't waste time by trying to describe with my limited vocabulary the beauty of this most famous game ever. I was introduced to this game by a next door\u0026nbsp;neighbor\u0026nbsp;when I was a kid, and I remember her laughing at my ability to understand the complex\u0026nbsp;maneuver of jumping over a pit. A few years later, a boy at my apartments taught me a few shortcuts involving pipes and creepers to reach level 8.1 quickly. He was struggling to finish this level within the stipulated time limit. It took a long time before we discovered by chance that Mario could not only walk, but he could also run. Our joy knew no bounds when we were finally able to conquer level 8.4 and save the Princess. I am not sure if anyone can make a game to equal this one. 3)\u0026nbsp;Kung Fu This was one of my favorites, simply because I was good at it. With simply 5 villains, each with unique style, this game guarantees fun. I\u0026nbsp;remember\u0026nbsp;a\u0026nbsp;partnership\u0026nbsp;ship I had with my flatmates, where we would play alternate chances each. Playing the last chance, I kept on defeating Wang, Tao, Chen, Lang, and Mu for a long time, until I was finally beaten by Lang, the toughest opponent of the lot. Never let Wang get close enough to you, and never let Chen move far enough. Jump on the walls, and kick Tao on the rebound, ahh, as I am writing this, my hands are itching to play this game again. 4) Commondos - Behind the enemy line I saw this game for the first time when a school mate took me to a browsing centre, and explained its virtues. It was a game perfectly suited for me. A very slow, stealthy game, it requires laying down elaborate strategies to complete the 20 levels. I have been able to reach only upto level 16 of this game, and one of these days, I will try completing the remaining 4. There is also a newer version of Commondos (Commondos 3) that has great graphics, but still retains the essence of the older version. \u0026nbsp;In an unforgettable stage in the original version, you have only Green Berret and Spy to try and destroy an air-plane at the other end of a mountain. You need to navigate your way through numerous minefields, and packs of Germans before you can complete the objective.\u0026nbsp;Commondos is probably my most favorite PC game. 5) Age of Empires I discovered this game along with a couple of my cousins, and we were awed by the concept. We first played a demo version which was extremely difficult. The campaign we played was called Battle of Kadesh and our empire was simply given three villagers, and minimal resources. Even before we could start developing the empire, red coloured militias will storm into our empire and slay unsuspecting villagers. My cousins and I sat together, and framed an elaborate strategy to ward of the attackers, slowly build a great\u0026nbsp;defense, and then start a cautious attack. We were so engrossed by the game that while returning from my cousins house, we would point at things around us at the railway station, and pass silly remarks such as \"mine here for gold\". The next version of the game, The Age of\u0026nbsp;Conquerors\u0026nbsp;was great too, but the subsequent versions lost the charm of the older versions. Personally, my favorite characters were the Teutonic Knights, Monks, and Elephants. 6) EA Cricket I have always had a fascination for cricket games, and EA Cricket is here purely because it is one of the very few cricket games in market. The very idea of creating my teams, setting fields, captaining a side excited the cricket fanatic in me, and I have spent a numerous hours playing this game. Despite the fact that it is a very monotonous game, I play it occasionally even today, and I have issued a stern warning to my brother against uninstalling it. 7)\u0026nbsp;Snake xenzia This was a game that originated from a less interesting version in Brick video game. Snake is believed by many to be the best cell-phone game before the advent of touch phones. I preferred snake xenzia because it was a little faster, and the snake looks more, err, snake-like. During my first year in college, I had\u0026nbsp;competitions\u0026nbsp;with my cousin who visited Trichy frequently, and we would break each other's high score record. We even discussed strategies to master this game. 8) Stick Cricket The best cricket game ever, its only drawback being that the game is very fast paced. We discovered the game in the first year of our undergraduate. The game had just been released, and was too young to be blocked by the proxy servers in our college. The game demands outrageous required rates, and makes us keep pace witch such run rates. My current week has been occupied by attempting to chase 450 odd runs in 20 overs against a Pakistan bowling attack filled with variety. I am also trying to master the android version of the game. Stick Cricket is so close to my heart that I had half-written a silly post about it during the third year of my college. It still lays unpublished in my drafts. 9) Table Tennis I discovered this game when I got a laptop during the\u0026nbsp;beginning\u0026nbsp;of the second year at my college. A simple flash game played only using mouse, I have always had the feeling that this game is a very useful stress buster. Whenever I felt down, I would have a go at this game. Numerous hours, which I labelled as breaks, \u0026nbsp;before my exams were spent playing this game. 10)\u0026nbsp;Johny Crash does Texas I came across this game in a friend's Sony Ericson mobile in my third year. The game simply involves flying and crashing at random objects, and meeting a specific target. It seems simple, but mastering the game requires quite a lot of practice, skill and luck. A game that can be played using a single button, it is another instance of a very simple idea turning out into an addictive game. I have tried arranging the 10 games in the order I started playing them. I might have missed quite a few games, but these were the first 10 that\u0026nbsp;occurred\u0026nbsp;to my mind, and hence these must be my most favorite. Just to list a few more interesting games - Tank (Brick video game),Pacman (PC,a delightful game), Duck Hunt (TV Video game), \u0026nbsp;Galaxian (TV), Loderunner(TV), Bomber Man(TV), Road Rash(PC), Bonkheads(PC), L A Noire (x-box), Red Dead Redemption\u0026nbsp;(x-box). Do let me know if I have missed a few more. Right now, I will be off to try and score three consecutive sixers of an off-spinner in stick cricket.

One such book, that had a great impact on me as I read it was The Sicilian.\u0026nbsp; Written by Mario Puzo, the author more famously known for his Godfather series, The Sicilian is a side story to The Godfather. It describes the events in Sicily, when Michael Corleone is spending a four year exile. The protagonist of The Sicilian is not Michael Corleone himself, but Salvatore \"Turi\" Guiliano. Turi is an intriguing character. For the first 20 years of his life,\u0026nbsp; he lives the life of a normal, sweet, and loved-by-all kid, who is over-shadowed by his more dominant friend Pisciotta. But when confronted with a challenge to his principles, he stands up for what he believes in, and ends up murdering a caribinieri. This incident leaves a mark on his life, and his hidden characterestics of dominance, fearlessness, and decision-making surface, soon converting him into a dreaded bandit. A good writer etches the characters of the novel so well that each reader will relate with the characters of the novel. Reading The Sicilian, I likened myself to Turi, and imagined myself as some one who is usually calm, but will stand up when a principle I believe in is threatened. I was of course cushioned by the fact that living in a democratic country like India, I may never face such a situation. I was sub-consciously convinced that revolutions occur only in fiction, or in History text books. But then, looking at the events of the past two years, my assumption that I will not have to put my secret fantasy to test was proved wrong time and again. There have been so many people who have stood for what they believe in the past two years that TIME's person of the year for 2011 was 'The Protestor'. These protests were not restricted to far-off places that hold no importance to us, a few of them were at our own home. There are indications that people around us have much more to protest, varying from occupy movements\u0026nbsp;for internet freedom to price rise and anti-corruption protests. There are many things to wonder about internet freedom, censorship,price hike and other issues, but I am more concerned about the anti-corruption protests here. Granted, I am about 10 months late in writing this, and there is almost no point in bringing it up now, but I just had to get this out of my mind. A little more than a year before, the country was hit by continuous reports of\u0026nbsp; corruption in the Central government, as well as various state governments. From literally nowhere, activist Anna Hazare sprang to the national scene by declaring a hunger strike in protest against corruption. Suddenly, the whole country found a vent for their hidden tendency of activism. People all over the country found a way by which they believed they could really contribute to the society. The protest was so widespread that skeptics were labelled as anti-national. Here was probably the closest opportunity I could probably get to stand up for the country's good. Here was the chance to bring out the \"Turi\"-like determinism in me. Yet, I chose to sit back, and just watch how it turns out to be, instead of walking to the beach with an \"I-love-Anna\" cap. My reasoning was very simple, and probably wrong. I will not join the anti-corruption movement until I can follow the traffic signal. Driving a lot around the city in the past two years, I have\u0026nbsp;realized\u0026nbsp;that the operational traffic rules in the city, and probably the whole country is very simple - never stop when the lights are green. When a signal is red, you can choose what to do. When it is orange, you can choose what to do, albeit you need to do it\u0026nbsp;carefully. The instance a signal is green, you need to to race away, or be subjected to severe abuse from the people behind you. Like this wonderful\u0026nbsp;advertisement\u0026nbsp;says, \"we are always in a hurry\" Looking at the alarming number of people who do not care to stop when a signal is red, I took a simple personal oath, that I will never jump a signal. Believe me, this seemingly simple act is extremely difficult. For someone riding a vehicle in the city, the temptation to jump a signal is always there, and I have often\u0026nbsp;succumbed\u0026nbsp;to it. There have been numerous times that I have been abused for stopping when a signal is Red. Just a week back, an aged two-wheeler rider watched me stop at a signal which was red for a long time. He came to me, and\u0026nbsp;whispered\u0026nbsp;\"poidunga sir, adhu work aagathu\" (Move on sir, the signal doesn't work). Just as he finished saying this, the signal turned green. It is often that we feel we are more mature than a stupid signal post, and are capable of making our own decisions. It is not unreasonable for us to get the impression that all rules in this country are \u0026nbsp;ill-thought out, made by people with less wisdom than us, and hence cumbersome. In our impatience, we feel it is only right to bend them for our own convenience. I firmly believe that it is this impatience that leads us to corruption. The desire to get things done fast is manifested into corruption, and from what I have seen, almost all of us have this desire. Corruption is in our genes, and it cannot be eradicated by passing a law against only a certain strata of the society. The irony of the whole Anna Hazare campaign is that Team-Anna, and its supporters have shown this quality of impatience in abundance. They have even went to the extent of trying to blackmail the Government to follow their whims. They need to understand that our country will be free from corruption only if we all are ready for it. They also need to understand that corruption is not the only hindrance to the betterment of our country. There are far more important issues to be concerned about. So in case you are joining Anna Hazare's fast today I wish you luck. I will not join you, at least not until I can confidently say that I don't jump signals.

We are thus enabled to call our ancestors barbarous. -Charles Dudley Warner Modern man is just ancient man... with way better electronics. -Unknown Having led a mostly impassive life, today was one of those occasions when I felt the need to react to whatever is happening around me. What is rare about today is that I have chosen to overcome my inherent laziness and write about it. As it often happens, the incident itself was minor, but it has caused me to vent out a few things that have been nagging me in the recent past. Now, if you have not set up a decent base in the wonderful social networking site twitter, you might not even be aware of the incident in question. So, let me just update you in brief. The Dirty Picture was scheduled to be screened in Setmax this afternoon. It seems the channel had acquired a clearance from the Bombay High Court, and was all set to screen the movie as per schedule (with quite a lot of cuts). Just before the\u0026nbsp;scheduled\u0026nbsp;time, the Ministry of Information and Broadcast, having suddenly decided that the movie is not proper for matinee viewing, directed the channel not to screen the movie during daytime, and to screen it after 11 PM instead. Now, this was just a passing news for page 3. I was not even aware of this snippet of information until I logged into twitter. What greeted me was an combined outrage by all the twitterati and twitteople. Having nothing better to do, I decided to click on the trending topics, and see what the fuss is all about. I saw that almost everyone seemed to be outraged at the fact that the Government was trying to decide what is suitable for us. The Dirty Picture trending on twitter Let me declare at the outset that I have nothing against the movie. In fact, I haven't watched it yet. Till an extent, I am against censorship too. An artist has the right to express what he considers as his opinion, and the citizens of the country have the right to choose if they need to experience the piece of art themselves. In fact, I am not concerned at all if the Ministry I \u0026amp; B was right in restricting the channel (I believe that their intention was correct.\u0026nbsp;Television\u0026nbsp;programs need censorship to an extent simply because they are easily accessible to children). But there are other things about this outrage that concerns me, and I have listed them below. 1) Time and again, various tweeters have expressed that twitter is a breath of fresh air from the mainstream media. They accuse the mainstream media of being sensationalist, while they consider twitter is more reliable in highlighting important events. I agree to this to a large extent, because I am pretty sure that my hang on current events has improved considerably since the time I started using twitter seriously. On the other hand, considering that twitter gives lesser importance to \u0026nbsp;a collector being abducted than a movie not being screened on TV, how can we accuse the mainstream media of being sensationalist? It is pretty clear that the media is just giving us what we want, and that the public should change their priorities first, before they can expect the media to. 2) The new generation of the people of India are quite 'modern' in their outlook. They have broken almost all the taboos of our forefathers, and will soon break all of them. From a predominantly theist country where Sadhus and Sanyasis prospered, we seem to be transforming into a country of agnostics and atheists, where\u0026nbsp;rock stars are prospering. Despite the accusations thrown on the internet, this generation reads a lot, watches movies made in every corner of the globe, mocks at superstition, fights for freedom of speech, takes feminism seriously, and often does this all with a refreshing sense of\u0026nbsp;humor. Most of these changes are heart-warming. But I feel that it might not be wise to discredit all the ideas our forefathers had. I can see a lot of people around me who project themselves as having a liberal mindset when they actually do not. It is as if being liberal is a fad, and people prefer being 'cool' over being themselves. If it is really true that people are blindly accepting the ideas of \u0026nbsp;liberalism simply because it is popular, it is a fearful thought. It is always dangerous to have only a single popular stream of belief throughout the globe, since these\u0026nbsp;people were as much the victims of popular belief as they were of the church. 3) The immediate reaction to this ban was to blame the Government. Looking at the trends of the past year, the modern day public is holding the Government, and sometimes the system itself, \u0026nbsp;responsible for everything wrong with the country. Instead of improving the system, or using it properly for betterment, we seem intent at completely rewriting the system. As the response to recent Anna Hazare protests (I have more to say on what I think about Anna in a partially completed post) showed, we are in danger of\u0026nbsp;discrediting\u0026nbsp;our democracy. The protests might be held with really noble intentions, but we must be careful that we do not slip into the anarchy. After all, the current global setting is perfect for anarchy to prevail. Note : My thoughts are fickle, and I change my opinion as per the popular opinion, usually opposing it.

Or at least, that is what the owner of this blog believes.) As soon as I was born, my mother came close to my ears, and whispered \"son, one day you could become anything. You could become anything you want\".\u0026nbsp; Thus the adage that you are in control of your own destiny was inflicted in me soon after my birth. I had no reason to doubt it, until I heard that voice on a fateful day soon after my 60th birthday. As soon as I heard the voice, the realization that my destiny was as much controlled by the other Man as by me, if not more, struck me like a lightning. I also realized that my mother had only been half-correct. The voice,belonging to a Man, had simply said \"Ah! That one would make an excellent bureau!\". With those words uttered by the voice, my life - a large part of which had been spent standing peacefully in a jungle among creatures behaving with a consistency that I now miss - changed its course. Though I didn't end up as a bureau, I ended up as an \"old teak chair\" \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; As you must have noticed by now, I am not an eloquent narrator. I would blame it on the lack of practice. It is not that I don't have much to say. Think about it, after all, like my brethren all around you, I have a keen eye for detail. It might be shocking for you to realize it, but my brethren and I have been watching you, and we have been noticing a lot of things you do when you believe that you are alone. No, it is not that I don't have much to say, it is just that, until now, I have never felt the need to say. But in the past few days, I have seen some really strange little things, strange even by my standards. Ever since I saw them, I have felt the irresistible need to talk about it. It is as all four of my legs would burst, unless I recount the short, but strange tale. Without further delay, let me describe the incident. My current master brought me for a worthy price at an auction a few years ago. Ever since, I have been the darling of his eyes or, rather his posterior. After a tiring day's work, nothing would relax him more that a peaceful sedentary session with me. Having lived at his house for quite sometime now, I had just begin to feel settled. I was hence surprised when my master packed me in a cardboard box few days ago. Blinded and suffocated, I could sense that I was being moved somewhere. As with all other journeys that I have been through, I had a tedious time throughout. I couldn't wait to come out of what seemed like a coffin, and get a whiff of fresh air. After what seemed to be a really long time(standards change when you are locked up in a box and are barely able to breath. I have seen Men change their standards for far less), we came to the end of our journey. I wasn't unpacked yet, and after a few minutes, I\u0026nbsp; was carried by hand somewhere. Judging by the change in pressure, I was being taken upwards (having spent most of my life in dormant positions, I am highly sensitive to changes in altitude). When I was finally able to open my eyes, I was in a room. The room smelt as if it had been cleaned only recently. From where I was placed, I couldn't see the entrance of the room, and worse, I couldn't watch the television. All I could see was a bed, placed in a perpendicular direction to me. By stretching my eyes a little to the left, I could see an open window. Rays of morning sunlight entered through the window, and illuminated the bed in front of me. I wondered if my master had shifted here for good. I was a bit upset at this thought, but the fact that I will still be owned by a person I had got used to cheered me up. From the other rooms, I could hear my master shifting more furniture. After about an hour, the sounds of furniture stopped. I could now hear footsteps, and they were moving away from me. I told myself that this was just a normal day, and like every other day, and the master would come back in the evening. Maybe he will pull me in front of the television, and fall asleep on me. Throughout the night, I could watch one of the most amazing inventions of Man. By now, I could hear the door shut, and his footsteps climb down a staircase. I had been right about the house being above the ground level. I desperately hoped that I was right about my master coming back to me too, but my intuition told me that he won't. The length of the sunlight in the room slowly receded as the Sun climbed up. I kept staring at the empty bed, and the wall behind it. Soon, it was dusk, and I still had nothing interesting to observe. For the first time in my long life, I regretted not being able to turn my neck around. I had no way I could see even the entrance door of the room. A couple of times through the day, I thought I heard a flutter outside the door, but realized that it was wishful thinking. Gradually, my mind was getting depressed contemplating the uninteresting future ahead of me, and this depression must have led me to sleep. I have no idea for how long I dozed. But when I did open my eyes, I saw the two of them. My initial reaction when I saw them was to be surprised at not having heard them walk in. With all due modesty, I have a very keen sense of hearing. In fact, my sense of hearing is so keen that by just hearing a person's footsteps once, I can easily identify him just by hearing him walk. I was surprised because I hadn't heard them walk across to the bed, and by the look of it, they had been in the same position for long. One of them was a middle-aged man, and the other was a young boy. The windows were drawn, and they were illuminated by a single candle placed before them. The boy was resting his head on the older man's lap. I was stripped of my initial surprise at not having heard their footsteps, attributing it to my disappointed state-of-mind, and was now filled instead with curiosity. They were already into a conversation. \"I felt it today uncle. I am sure something is about to happen\". The boy said, in a voice that betrayed fear.\nWhen the older man replied, his voice seemed to come from a distance, as if it didn't belong to the him. \"Nothing will happen my boy. They won't dare to come here.\"\n\"I am afraid of them. I really hope they don't come here.\"\n\"You have nothing to be afraid of. I have been living here for quite sometime now, and I have never felt their presence here. Now, you have had a tiring day, and it's time to go to bed. Did you drink the\u0026nbsp; milk I kept for in the kitchen?\"\n\"No, I forgot\"\n\"Quick then, drink the milk, and sleep\", the uncle said, his voice now raised to a gentle command. The boy got up, and walked with an unconvinced look. My mind registered his footsteps as unnaturally light. The uncle blew the candle, and the room was cast into complete darkness. I could hear some notice from the kitchen, wherever it was, but the noise stopped soon. As the minutes passed, the house seemed to be eerily silent. I kept vigil for a few more minutes, staring at the blankness and seeing nothing, and finally I dozed off. When I woke up again, the uncle was not in the room. Once again, my senses had failed to awake me at the sound of his foot-steps. I could hear very light footsteps walking around from the other rooms, and I identified the footsteps as that of the boy. Not much happened for a long time, and occasionally I could hear the boy roaming around the house. Around noon, after a reasonable period of silence, I could again hear the boy's footsteps. I didn't give much attention to it, and continued to concentrate on what I had been doing, which was nothing. But then, I heard two people climbing up the stairs. Both pairs of footsteps were new to me, and I wondered if one of them belonged to the uncle. In a couple of minutes, the boy must have heard them too, because his footsteps stopped abruptly. Now, I could even hear voices. Abruptly, I could hear the running footsteps of the boy, and I realized that he was coming towards my room. He soon entered the room, and I could see that he was frightened of the footsteps from outside. He closed the door of the room without locking it, ran and attempted to hide behind the head of the bed. His eyes were facing the door, and I could see his face, which was white with fear. I had no doubt that anyone else walking into the room can see him too. Meanwhile, the noise from outside the house increased. The footsteps had momentarily stopped, and I heard a\u0026nbsp; key being inserted into a lock. The door opened, and one loud and masculine set of footsteps entered the house. Apparently, the other person stayed outside the door.\u0026nbsp; The Man who had entered the house seemed to be unaware of the tension in the room I was in, and he seemed to be casually wandering around the house. With each passing moment the boy in front of me turned whiter. The footsteps from outside came closer towards my room now, and there was a creak as the door opened. A couple of steps more, and I could see an unremarkable man walking inside the room, whilst looking at me with mild interest. He was now exactly front of me, and was turning his head toward the bed. I turned my full attention to the boy. He was shaking with fear, but rooted to his spot, as if the visitor might attack him anytime. And then I heard the ear-piercing shriek. It took me a moment to realize that it was coming from the visitor. The man seemed to be as much afraid of the boy, as the boy was of him. He was still shouting, as he took a couple of steps back, turned around and ran out, knocking a few things on his way out. The boy still stood at the same spot. I could soon hear blurred voices from outside. The visitors were running down the stairs. I heard the women shout something like \"I told you so! The neighbor warned us before coming here. This must be the reason he offered the house at such a low price!\" As the noises faded, the house was cast back into silence. The boy just stood there for sometime, and soon walked out of the room. Soon, he climbed down the stairs, and I was left to myself once again. I had plenty of time to ponder over what had happened, but still couldn't make head or tail out of it. A few more hours passed before I heard the boy's footsteps again. It seemed the boy was speaking to himself as he climbed the steps. As the door to the house opened, I could make out what he said. \"No, you go in first.\" He still sounded agitated. I was startled when I heard another voice replying to him. \"All right, you stay outside for a minute. See, no one is inside. And I am sure no one will be coming back for sometime\". It was the uncle.\n\"You are so sure of everything.\" The boy entered the house, and his voice lost some of its initial fear. \"But, why didn't you believe me when I said they were coming. You almost convinced me that they won't\". The uncle sighed, took a deep breath. \"Look\", the uncle started speaking in a explanatory tone, \"you are very young, and you are very new here. Whereas, I have been here for quite some time\". The faint footsteps of the boy becoming a little stronger as he spoke. Both of them were walking towards my room. \"As time goes on\", he continued, \"you will start losing all your senses. It starts with your sense of touch, and when you are as old as me,it becomes very difficult to sense these humans. Soon, you will start moving like me too\". \"Humans!\", he uttered the word as I would have uttered them, if only I could speak - with rage, combined with a feeling of powerlessness. \"These humans are everywhere. They take over all houses, destroy them, and rebuild them. At this rate, we soon won't have any more houses to haunt.\" As he said this, the uncle entered the room. As soon as I saw him, I understood why I had never been able to hear his footsteps. He didn't walk, but glided in. It was almost as if he didn't have a pair of feet.

Like most typical Indian under-graduation course, ours too was in the danger of contributing not many things to our life. It is not the fault of the system - I will have the authority to blame the system only if I had extracted everything I could from it, and had found that the system had nothing more to offer to me. Before I go into a philosophical mode, let me try getting back to the point. Some of my friends were keen to make use of the cultural event held at our college. We were aiming for the ad-zap event, but the posters of the Photography and Videography events held our attention longer that they ought to have, considering that we didn't even have a 5 MP digital camera with us. But it did, and the rest, as they say, is History.Forgotten history is History too, isn't it? We went on to make a first \"short-film\" despite many hurdles. As expected, it failed miserably. This didn't deter us, and we went on to make a second \"short-film\", which failed too. But, the fun we had while making these films were immense, and it made us appreciate the difficulties in making a full length feature film. I might write about the actual experiences in a later blog post. For now, I have decided to post the scripts written by me for these two movies. A little about the script, before I actually paste it here. The story's ending is a conscious rehash of a Hindi movie that I had seen as a child and had a profoundly effect on me (just discovered that it is written and directed by two very famous people). The underlying situation is from a novel by one my my all time favorite authors. So, here is the script. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; TITLE - The Intruder\nScene 1 - Dark Ext Focus on a compound wall.\u0026nbsp; A person (man 1) jumps over the wall from the other side. He carries a packed bag with him. Focus on him for some time as he runs through the street. Scene 2 - Dark Ext\nFocus on the gate of an individual house. Man 1 comes running from outside, enters the gate, and goes towards the door. He pants, as he bangs the door twice and moves aside. The door opens, a man (Man 2) peeps out of the door without opening the door. Finding no one, he opens the door fully. Man 1, who was hiding beside the door jumps out\u0026nbsp; suddenly and points a gun towards Man 2. Man 1: Don’t make a noise, this thing works.\u0026nbsp; Just do as I say. Man 2 looks startled, but recovers quickly. He nods his head and says.. Man 2: I will do as you say, please don’t shoot. Man 1 points inside the house. Man 2 nods and moves slowly enters. Man 1 follows him closing the door. His eyes and the gun never leave the other person. Scene 3- Int\nMan 2: Who are you? You can take whatever you want, but don’t hurt me. Man 1: I am already rich (nods towards the bag in his hand, out of which one or two jewels are visible from outside). Man 2: Then why are you here? He waits for an answer, but doesn’t get any. Instead, sounds of the door knocking are heard again. Man 2 looks questioningly at Man 1. Man 1 gets tensed up.\nMan 1: (whispering) Open the door slightly, and send whoever is there back. One wrong move and your head will be punctured. Man 2 nods, and walks towards the door.\u0026nbsp; Man 1 follows him, with the gun kept pointed. He stands on one side of the door. Man 2 opens the door a little, and peeps out. Scene 3\u0026nbsp; - Int, Ext\nMan 2: (his voice filled a little fake anger) who is it?\nMan: Did you hear someone come this side? There’s been a theft.\nMan 2: (softens his tone a little) No, I didn’t hear anything. Where did it happen?\nMan: In the next street. Keep your doors locked. Call the police if you see or hear anything suspicious.\nMan 2: Sure.\nThe man leaves the house and Man 2 looks at Man 1 for approval. Man 1 relaxes a little, and Man 2 walks slowly towards the centre of the hall. Man 1 places his bag down. They remain standing for some time. Man 1 suddenly realises this. Man 2: (points towards a chair) Mind if I sit down?\nMan 1 gives an unsure look. Man 2 makes use of this pause and pulls a chair. Man 1 remains standing for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought says.. Man 1: Do you have a cell phone? (Man 2 nods his head) Take it out slowly (he reemphasises the presence of the gun), switch it off and give it to me? (Raises his voice a little) Understand?\nMan 2: Yeah. I used to do this often in my college. (He follows the instructions)\nMan 1: Landline?\nMan 2 nods his head to indicate no. Man 1 confirms by looking around, spots another chair. He hesitates, and then he pulls a chair too. The clock shows 12:25. Fade away.\nScene 4 - Int\nThe clock shows 12:40. Man 2 is calm but restless. Man 1 is restless too, and tensed. Man 2: Shall I switch on the T.V.?\nMan 1 thinks for a moment, and then nods. Man 2 switches on the T.V. using the remote, and offers the remote to Man 1. He shrugs as Man 1 refuses, and starts surfing the channels. As the camera moves backward, sound of different songs, advertisements are heard. Finally, the sound settles down at some cricket commentary. Scene 5 - Int The clock shows 12:55 Both of them seem to be engrossed in the match. Man 1 still keeps his gun clutched tightly. Man 2: This man seems have a lot of luck. It will leave him soon though.\nMan 1: Dhoni is a great captain.\nMan 2: (Laughs sarcastically) He is not as good as they claim.\nMan 1 suddenly gets up, pushes the gun towards the other person and repeats his words. Man 2: (Looks startled for a moment) Sorry, sorry, Dhoni is the greatest captain we have ever had!\nMan 1 realises he is standing, and takes his seat again. Filler The clock shows different times, and the two people are shown sitting in the same positions, with slight modifications. Scene 6 - Int The clock shows 01:05. Man 1 is sitting in a more relaxed posture. Man 2 sits casually, but seems a little restless. He keeps looking at the clock. Both are munching something (maybe biscuits). Suddenly a sound is heard outside. Man 1 looks towards the direction of the sound. Man 2 lunges towards him. The camera shifts to some stationary point nearby. Muffled sounds of a struggle are heard, and finally a muffled shout is heard. Camera shifts towards the centre. Man 1, is lying down, looks dead. Man 2 stands with a bloody knife in his hands. He looks around, puts the knife down. The horn (the same sound that was heard first) rings again in a kind of a signal. He looks around again, spots the bag carried by Man 1. He picks it up, and picks another bag lying in a corner. He walks slowly towards the door, gives one last look around the hall, and walks out, closing the door behind him. Outside, a person with a helmet is waiting in a bike. Man 2 walks towards him, says something like you are late, and sits behind. The bike moves away from the house. The camera enters the house again, and goes into a inner room. The camera focuses on a second dead body (say, of Man 3) lies, covered with a blanket. Only his face is visible. The camera moves towards the wall, where a framed photo of the dead man hangs. The camera focuses again on the dead man and freezes. Credits.\nA few noteworthy points 1) This is not how you write a standard script. There are certain conventions followed while writing a script, and there are special considerations to be made. Hopefully, what I have written is at least readable\u0026nbsp; 2) If the script looks like crap, the actual movie we made is even crappier and amateurish. we borrowed a camera, and thought ourselves to hold it. We had no idea where the light sources should be while capturing a scene. After instructing my friends acting in the movie to enact each scene as slowly as they could, we ended up with a 15 minute video. Realising that the contest allowed a maximum screening time of 3 minutes, we ended up deleting most of the scenes we shot, and running the rest at a higher speed. We downloaded an editing software from the internet and learnt to use it, and used it, in just 2 days. 3) Watch out for a fleeting performance by self (Yeah, I know. The video by itself is fleeting, and that's how long it will stay in your mind when you end watching it). 4) I will end this post with the tragic announcement that the second script I wrote will be up on the blog in two days ( the two day gap is for effect). It is a fantasy with what I hope to a dose of humour I would have been proud of it, if I had written it while I was fourteen, and got it published in\u0026nbsp; a school magazine. But as they say, better late than never :) ","date":"14 March 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-intruder/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Intruder","type":"posts"},{"content":" It is an emotional moment for me. My idol in cricket, and sometimes in life, Rahul Dravid, has just retired from test cricket. I did want to write a post on how I feel about his retirement, but much has been written about him already, and I don't trust my writing skills to do justice to the greatness of the man.If I remember correctly, I stopped supporting the Indian ODI team since Dravid was dropped. I am not sure if I will be supporting the Indian Test team anymore, but I am fairly sure that it depends, in part, on who will be replacing him.\u0026nbsp; It will be interesting to see what Dravid's retirement means to the Indian Test team. It has been more than 3 years since Saurav Ganguly retired, and it has taken all that time to find a possible\u0026nbsp; replacement in Virat Kohli. When Laxman and Sachin retire eventually, India would be left with just four experienced batsmen : Sehwag, Gambhir, Dhoni, and possibly Yuvraj. Of this, only Gambhir has been fairly consistent. The number 3 position occupied by Dravid would be even more crucial, considering that the middle order would be inexperienced. A lot of cricket writers have come out with possible replacements for this position. Since I do not agree with some of their choices, I have set out to list the players that I consider as possible No. 3 batsman. Of these players, the selectors and the team management would be trying out just one or two players initially giving them a long run. Considering that the next few Test matches are being played at home, these two players would have the maximum chance to cement their places. 1) Cheteshwar Pujara I have listed Pujara first because I have always had a liking for him. Already in the selection committee radar for his perfect technique, he is a classical and orthodox cricketer best suited to replace Dravid at No. 3. He once scored a stunning century in the fourth innings securing an unlikely win for Saurashtra against Karnataka (Rahul Dravid watched this innings first hand, since he was playing for Karnataka). His innings against Australia when he was promoted to number 3 ahead of Dravid led Ian Chappell to write that Dravid must be dropped to make way for this youngster. But, there are a few things going against him. He has just come back from a serious injury, and is yet to make any impression in the domestic matches since his return. While Pujara was nursing his injury, Kohli has cemented his spot, and Rohit almost cemented his spot. 2) Gautam Gambhir Most people leave out Gambhir's name while talking about the number 3 spot. This is surprising considering that he has done well in this position in ODIs. He is a great player of spin, and has played some wonderful knocks. One may argue that Gambhir is more important as an opener. I don't think so. A lot of openers have been tried by the Indian team in the past few years, and many of them have been fairly successful. There are a few other openers in the reckoning too. If any of them, say a Rahane or a Mukund, could take the role of the opener, Gambhir can play at number 3. This would be ideal, as he can guide the inexperienced middle order too. 3) Virat Kohli Virat Kohli has already cemented a spot in the playing XI, and only his batting position is yet to be determined. Personally, I feel that a Pujara or a Gambhir would be better replacement for Dravid. But, we are assuming that the spot left by Rahul Dravid must be taken by a player of the same mold. Having such a player would definitely be a advantage, but it is not easy.\u0026nbsp; Kohli has shown that he is ready to take challenges head-on, and his decent success at Australia would give him immense confidence. Now, if only he tries to play the game in a more dignified manner, we have a long term prospect. 4) Subramaniam Badrinath Badrinath is a fantastic batsman, who as been on the selector's radar for a very long time. But, I am afraid that he has remained on the radar for too long, and now owing to his age, he is slowly moving away from the radar. He did get a few opportunities at the national level, but he was unable to convert them. He made a half-century on his debut. It is largely felt that he did not get enough chances to prove himself, but he was unlucky to have played in an era when the Indian Test team's middle order was dominated by heavy weights. It would be wonderful to see him get his due at the national level. His style of batting is perfectly suited for the one-drop position 5) Ajinkya Rahane A lot of cricket experts talk about Rahane being the next big thing. He has been tested only in the shorter formats at the national level, and has had mixed success. But, his debut T20 innings showed him to be a nerveless batsman with a calm head. He too has a lot of domestic runs to back him up. Though he is being touted as a prospect for middle order, I would personally like to see him open the batting with Virendar Sehwag. Now, if India has to do well as a Test team in the coming years, one of these players would really have to do well. Meanwhile, it would be interesting to see if the two remaining pillars in the team are affected by not having Dravid to consistently see off the new ball.

It is that time of the year, when everyone tries to list and rate their favorite moments in the past year. It is that time of the year when everyone who calls himself a film critic tries to list movies that they consider to be the best and the worst. I am not, in any way, qualified to be called as a film critic. I call myself a film buff, but any given day, I would prefer to simply sit and stare at my Facebook wall and Twitter timeline, rather than watch a movie. There are about 50 movies in my laptop and PC, that I have accumulated over the last four years hoping that I would one day see them, but never doing it. Yet, for some reason, a part of my mind wanted to list out my favorite Tamil movies of my year. There was another part of my mind debating against this, and roughly, the debate went like this\nFirst part\u0026nbsp; : You haven't written anything worthwhile for ages. The only things you wrote last year consisted of official emails, and even these were usually among the following types \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; We are working on it. We will get back to you soon. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Please advice. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Please suggest. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Please assist. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; We are still working on it. We will get back to you soon. You seriously need to improve your writing skills. Content is not important, You just need to write something.\nSecond Part:\u0026nbsp; You haven't written anything worthwhile for ages. Most people think this blog is dead. Who are you writing for?\n1 : Don't miss this opportunity to get your blog going again. Writing about movies is the easiest thing to do. Do it before the New Year fever dies. And, as long as there are a few people who say that anything you write is good, you have got nothing to worry about.\n2 : You don't see a lot of movies. You have missed many supposedly good movies. Your list will not consider all movies. And, there were at least 4 movies having Dhanush in it this year. Your list will be biased.\n1\u0026nbsp; : So what? There are no impartial reveiwers.\n2 : You are not a reviewer. You neither have a critic's eye, nor a common man's eye. You love movies like Arai En 305il Kadavul, Baba and Ratchagan, whereas you hate the commercially successful 7Am Arivu.\n1 : Enough. Stop wasting time and space, and start writing already.\nWell, such debates are not unusual within me, and I usually (and evidently) succumb to the second part of my mind.For once, I decided to go with the other part of my mind. So, here goes the list..\nMy Most Favorite Tamil Movies of 2011\n9. Vaanam\nShocking? This movie is here only to complete the list. I don't completely love this movie, and wouldn't recommend it to everyone. But, I feel it is worth a watch for some fantastic performances, lead by Simbhu, Saranya Mohan, Anushka, and Prakash Raj. A novel screenplay in Tamil movies that has five diffent storilines. It traces the stories of Cable Raja (Simbhu) who wants money desperately to continue his relationship with his girlfriend, Bharath(Bharath) a rich and spoilt rockstar, Saroja(Anuska) a prostitute, a muslim couple Rahim(Prakash Raj) and Zara (Sonia Aggarwal), and Lakshmi (Saranya Ponvanan) - a poor women trying to raise some money to rescue her son from a debtor.The movie deals with the sufferings of the poor without going overboard. Simbhu's acting when he is reluctantly forced to steal from others is the one of the biggest reasons I love this movie. 8 - Ko\nI am not sure where exactly this movie should be in this list. I have placed this so low just because it is a commercial/mass movie. Directed by K.V.Anand, the movie is a very good entertainer. The thing I like about K.V.Anand is that he doesn't seem to take himself very seriously. To me, a good actor is one watching whom you don't realise he is acting. In that way, Jeeva does a fantastic job. So do Pia Bajpai, Ajmal, Prakash Raj and Kota Sreenivasa Rao. The situations happening in the the press offices are delightful. After all, K.V.Anand was himself a photo journalist. We will have to wait and see if the movie's upcoming Hindi remake will be as good.\n7. Payanam\nAfter giving some delightful movies like Azhagiya Theeye, Mozhi, Abhiyum Naanum, director Radha Mohan attempted a thriller. The movie is about a hijacked flight. With all the passengers held hostage, a national Security Guard(Nagarjun) and a National Security Advisor (Prakash Raj) formulate a plan to rescue them. Though the movie did fail on the thrill quotient, it still had some of the elements that made the director's earlier movies great. It had some fantastic performances by almost all actors, led by Nagarjun, Prakash Raj and my favorite Chaams. Though the screenplay had its share off loopholes, I was ready to forget them seeing the scene where Nagarjun\u0026nbsp; asks \"Red Hills ah? Adhu evalavu thuram?\" . The scene showed that the makers were atleast trying to have a semblance of logic. (As a side note,in Dasavatharam, Flethcher was able to navigate throughout Tamil Nadu as if he was in his own backyard).\n6. Yuddham Sei\nA movie from one of my favorite directors Myshkin should have been higher up on the list, but I hated the second half of this movie. J.K. (Cheran) is a CB-CID officer, whose sister goes missing. With no clues to trace his sister, he reluctantly takes up another case where a series of people are being brutally murdered. But as he digs deeper into the case, it looks like the case is related to another case, where a series of women including his own sister go missing. The first half of the movie is great, with Cheran's acting being a revealation, but the climax turns out to resemble a zombie movie.Worth a watch for its fantastic screenplay, and some signature scenes from Myshkin.\n5. Mayakkam Enna\nA Selvaraghavan-Dhanush movie. The movie traces the life of Karthik(Dhanush), a wannabe wild life photographer. He and his sister are supported by his group of friends Sundhar, Sankar, padmini and Vindhya. The arrival of Sundhar's girl friend Yamini (Richa Gangopadhyay) changes his life, for bad, and for good. Like any other Selvaraghavan movie, the movie has some wonderful scenes, and some ordinary scenes. Frankly, I am unable to decide if this movie is really good. But, no one can deny that Selvaraghavan can extract the best out of my favorite actor, Dhanush. And as expected, Dhanush's acting is stunning. Like Selva's other movies, all characters are realistic, because no character is perfect. And this movie will go down as a rare Selvaraghavan movie that has a happily-ever-after ending.\n4.Azhagarsamiyin Kudhirai\nThe third movie by director Suseenthran, and as good as the first two, if not more. The director's fourth movie also finds a place in this blog post, further below. With no big names in the cast, this movie is about a superstitious village Mallayapuram near Theni. Just before the annual Temple Festival (Thiruvizha) of the village, someone steals the wooden horse considered as the village diety Azhagarsamy's vehicle (Vahanam). The villagers are convinced that the horse belonging to another youth (the unlikely Protogonist, again called Azhagarsamy) is the diety's own horse, magically given a life of its own. The movie is about how the young lad, whose livelyhood depends upon his horse, gets it back. Each character in the movie is delightful. Just in case you didn't know, the music is by Maestro Illayaraja. 3. Aaranya Kaandam\nDirected by debuttante Kumararaja, it is the Tamil(or even Indian) movie that is closest to the class of a Quentin Tarantino's creation. The actions of a wannabe-big-gangster Pashupathy (Sampath, one of the finest actors) cause an explosive cascade of events, touching the lives of the ageing old don Singa Perumal (a brillian Jackie Shroff), an innocent and ridiculed misfit Sappai (Ravi Krishna), a wannabe actress held in the clutches of Singaperuma - Subbu (Yasmin Ponnappa), the pauper farmer Kalayan (an excellent find, Somasundaram) and his son Kodukkupulli (Master Vasaanth). Yuvan Sankar Raja's stunning BGM is worth a mention.\n2. Aadukalam The national award winning movie directed by Vetrimaran (his second movie after the really good Pollathavan), and starring Dhanush. The movie is set in a backdrop of Rooster Fights. Pettaikaran (Jayabalan) is the most reverred name in rooster figths, assisted by Karuppu(Dhanush) and Durai (The fantastic actor Kishore).Rathnasamy is their arch competetor. In the heat of an important competition, Karuppu decides to go against the better judgements of Pettaikaran. The movie deals with the emotional fallout of this action. The thing that strikes me the most about this movie is the raw emotions that each character in the movie has. Even the heros sidekick gets angry at a point of time. Every single actor does justice to the characters he/she plays. Though many people felt that the second half of the movie to be slow, I personally love it.\n1. Engeyum Eppodhum Produced by\u0026nbsp; director A.R.Murugadoss, and directed by debutante Saravanan, this is a delightful movie. Though most people I know would cringe at what I am going to say, to me this is a feel good movie. I felt really good for 3/4th of the movie. The movie starts and ends with a bus accident, and traces the story of two couples involved in the accident. A fantastic screenplay, with a liberal dose of really good humour makes this movie a must watch. The scene depicting the actual accident has so much impact that some people I know hesitate to travel by road after watching this movie. The movie's greatness lies in the fact that there is no single thing that really stands out. This movie was lauded by almost everyone who saw it, but I still feel that it has been under-rated.\nMovies that might have made the list, had I watched them (in no particular order):\n1) Aanmai Thavarael - A movie about human traficking, that got pretty decent reviews. 2) Muran - An adaptation of the Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. Starring Cheran and prasanna, this movie got rave reviews. 3) Vaagai Sooda Vaa - Directed by Sarkunam of Kalavani fame, and starring actor Vimal. The movie is set in 1960s, and is about an teacher who tries to educate the children of a village. 4) Mouna Guru : Directed by Santha Kumar, and starring Karunanidhi's grandson Arulnithi, no one would have cared for this movie. But unexpectedly, it has made its way to the top 5 list of every critic I respect. It is supposed to be among the best thrillers in Tamil. 5) Nadunissi Naaygal : Directed by Gautham Menon, and starring Sameera Reddy, this movie is in the list of everyone's worst-movies-of-the-year list. Isn't that reason enough to watch it once?\nAnd finally, a word of advice on certain movies that you should avoid at all costs (Please note that this list is by no means exhaustive. After all, 134 movies were released in Kollywood last year).\n1) Nootrenbadhu(180) : Directed by Actor Jayendra, and starring actor Siddharth, whose twitter biopic reads \"Stuck in the wrestling match between commerce and art\", this goes down as one of the most hypocritical movie I have ever scene. There is not even a single shred of logic in the movie. 2)Avan Ivan\u0026nbsp; : When guests visit their houses, some parents ask their children to entertain the guests by activities such as singing and dancing. At the end of the show, regardless of whether they enjoyed it , the guests are expected to say something to the effect \"Wow, you are so talented! You deserve an award!!\". Watching this movie, one feels that director Bala was attempting to showcase the talents of Vishal and Arya in the same way.\u0026nbsp; Vishal and Arya are grown up men, and should not expect such encouraging words. And Director Bala should stop making movies until he understands that movies should be either be entertaining or intelligent. Just being violent, gory and in-your face doesn't make a movie artistic 3) 7Am Arivu : Directed by A.R.Murugadoss, a movie full of crap. I strongly suspect that the director has been influenced by Aamir Khan.\n4) Rajapattai : Vikram has shown a strong influence to bad movies in the past, and Rajapattai is a real bad movie. I have added this here just because this movie is directed by Suseendhran, whose earlier movie Azhagarsamiyin Kudhirai (4th in the list above) was a complete commercial failure.\nPS : Admittedly, this is a really long post. If history is to provide any indication, I have exceeded my word-limit-quota for this whole year (just like our PM Manmohan Singh must have done in his New Year message)\nPPS : After posting the blog, I realised that I had missed a important movie, Deiva Thirumagal. This movie would definitely be in my top 10- probably before Yudham Sei.\n","date":"1 January 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/kollywood-in-2011---my-personal-favourites/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Kollywood in 2011 - My Personal Favourites","type":"posts"},{"content":" There are two kinds of audiences for Tamil movies. The first is the average Tamil audience. It consists of people who see cinema like Shakespeare did, as ‘a willing suspension of disbelief”. They are perfectly satisfied with an average commercial movie. They enjoy the movie of their favorite hero, and their facebook status immediately say “xxxxx, a must watch! Thalaivar Rocks!!”. The second kind of audience would immediately make a sarcastic comment on the status. They would probably list out a couple of Hollywood movies, one Japanese movie and a Korean movie with similar plots, and would further point out that the “Rocking” movie was worth the watch even with a storyline borrowed from so many movies. These are the self-proclaimed critics. Give them the smallest opportunity, and they will clear their throat, take a deep breath, and list out at least 5 logical flaws in an average Tamil movie, and then go on about the quality of Hollywood movies. They would generally labor a frustration against the naiveté of the masses. To which of these two groups do I belong? Well, I lean a little towards the second kind.\nIt is not that I don’t like commercial movies. As a 9 year old, I was forced to see the movie \"Ratchagan\". I had never heard about the movie before, and my limited knowledge of the Tamil language didn't help me in deciphering the title. I was sitting in the theater expecting a rural romance, and was greeted with the opening scene, where a burly looking guy pushes a truck-load of cars into a valley. What followed this was a lot of action - cars, containers, bombs, helicopters, Girish Karnaud, Raghuvaran, and yeah, Nagarjun. I totally loved the movie! Even today, 13 years later, I wouldn't mind watching the movie again. I am sure each of us has our own favorites among such logic-defying movies.\nOne of the recent Tamil movies I loved was Tamizh Padam. For those of you who aren't aware of it, it is a spoof of the typical Tamil 'formula' film. Tamizh Padam scores because it is not a product of anger against the predictability of Tamil movies, but a product of self-depreciating humor. It is a kind of movie that laughs at our “formula” films, while being perfectly aware that nothing will stop us from loving such movies. The flipside of the movie was that it was a bit of a drag. At some point of time, the director must have felt that he will not get an opportunity to make another spoof, and included as many elements as possible. One gets to feel that the film would have been far better if the spoof had been on a single theme, instead of taking on Tamil movies as a whole. This is where we come to the beginning of this post.\nAll I wanted to do in this post was to try and find out why I don’t write any blog posts. There were a few things that I really wanted to write about, and I did try. I usually start writing about something, get carried away and end up in a totally different place. It can’t be helped, that is the way I talk too. If you ask me about my favorite novel, you will get to know about five novels I like, three I didn’t particularly like, and one I hated. So, whenever I sat to write a post, I had to modify it to accompany a new topic, and then re-model it. Following this, I would delete it and start rewriting the whole thing. By this time, my energy would have gone and I would just save it to my drafts. So, how did I post this one? I just thought this post reflects my whole thinking process. And as every human being sub-consciously knows, confessing a crime give one a full license to commit it again and again. Now, before I venture into philosophy, I will just announce that I am going to try and stick to as few topics as I possibly can in a single post. I am reminded of a E-Mail writing sessions in TCS training, where the facilitator used to insist that every e-mail should deal with only one subject. Half of me would like to write more about my TCS training, but I think you have got the drift by now.\nSo, till the next post, if it does come, goodbye! ","date":"4 December 2010","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/22010/12/excuse-for-my-prolonged-absence/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"An excuse for my prolonged absence!","type":"posts"},{"content":" Let me start by informing that I have got back access to net. That doesn’t mean I will be more regular with blogging. I am realizing that blogging is difficult for a person as lazy as me. My net connection works at an excruciating speed. For instance, I open my yahoo mail account to be greeted by the message “Hello V!”, I click the link “Inbox”, and I wait for 5 minutes. It was during the long wait yesterday that my eyes fell on the “buzz” tab below. The first item was: “ ‘My Name is Khan’ earns Rs.150 cr in a week”. I didn’t think much about it initially, and I soon realized that 6 minutes had passed since I pressed the link “inbox”. Losing patience, I clicked the “Reload” button, and immediately regretted it. During the next five minutes, and the subsequent periods of waiting, I had some interesting thoughts.\nMKIK was released on the 12th of this month amidst a lot of controversies. I know a lot has been said about this already, but I feel a need to air my views. Bravo, Mr. Khan! Bravo, the media! And Bravo, movie enthusiasts! What a fitting reply to the advocates of separatism! It took a lot of bravery from Shahrukh to come out in the open with his views. I later came across another article saying that the ticket sales of MKIK have fallen by 20%. There are people who doubt the veracity of the whole episode, claiming that the whole thing was a publicity stunt. But I am inclined to disagree. Actors like Shahrukh , Aamir Khan and Salmaan Khan have achieved such stardom not because of not only because of their acting skills. They have wonderful marketing skills. Shiv Sena or no Shiv Sena, they would have found a way to influence the opening week’s collections. Nevertheless, the release of the movie by itself was impressive, given the amount of security devoted to the theatres. Someone pointed out to me that the week had one more incident of trivial importance attached to it, the Pune blast. They even made the preposterous suggestion that the blast might have been avoided if only the security had not been busy protecting the theater screens. Now, that’s a very hypothetical argument. Moreover, like Naseerudin Shah(or was it Kamal?) mentions in ‘A Wednesday’, these common men are destined to die anyway. Entertainment is a basic necessity of the human mind, and the actors are the entertainers who selflessly work for our benefit. They are the salt of the Earth, and foremost importance must be given to them. Many great rulers have known this truth, and have done everything to implement it. Take the state I live in, for example. Practically all movies are given tax concessions, whereas the prices of essential commodities are given lower priority. Everyone is encouraged to watch movies. I recently watched a movie in a theatre in Tanjore for the paltry sum of Rs.100. I comfortably sat in a third row filled with seats having wooden seat, and I fall short of words when I try to describe the sound system. Why would I watch a pirated version of the movie when the theatrical experience so good, and yet so cheap? In the same vein, my thoughts, as they often do, shifted to cricket. These are really bad times for us. The pride of the nation, IPL is being ridden with self-doubts. Various security threats are making players reconsider taking part in the event. But again, the organizers of the event are facing things bravely. The overseas players must be convinced to play, and complete security must be provided to the event. Of course, we need not worry about terror attacks everywhere- even the terrorists would be engrossed in the IPL.\nThere are other important developments in Tamil Nadu. Reportedly, theaters around the state are planning to telecast the matches live, and film producers are trying to get the court’s help in preventing this. They fear, rightly, that their collections would go down drastically. On the other hand, a few actors have managed to turn the wrath of politicians towards them. Kollywood is being pitted against the man power of politics and the money power of IPL. I don’t think it can survive either of them. But still, actors, cricketers and politicians are very important to our nation. They have sacrificed their whole life to entertain us, and we must protect them from any troubles they are facing.\nAmple security must be provided to all of them. If there are any security personals left, they must be assigned to protect the tigers. Reportedly, there are just 1411 tigers left in the country. After all, there are more than a billion men, women and children. ","date":"23 February 2010","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-selfless-entertainers/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Selfless Entertainers","type":"posts"},{"content":" This one is about my role models : Rahul Dravid, Rajinikant and Roger Federer. Let's start with Rajinikant - The Superstar, a person who is as much despised as he is admired. I will start by making it clear that to me, Rajini is an over-rated hero, but an under-rated actor. His story is a fairy-tale. He came from a different state, wasn't even able to speak Tamil properly, didn't have a mentor in the industry, started with very small roles, and still made it so big. Contrary to popular views, his being dark-coloured was more of a disadvantage than an advantage. The MGRs, Sivajis, Kamals ruling the market were mostly fair-skinned. He started as a very good actor. You need to be a good actor to be a part of films directed by the likes of K.B. and Bharathiraja. He was a master of underplay. But people were more attracted to his charisma than his acting skills. So, somewhere down the line, he made a decision to stop acting, and put to full use his charisma. But, today's generation has been over-exposed to attempts by various heros to cash in their charisma - even if they don't have one - and as a result, his popularity is declining gradually. Even hardcore Rajini fans don't believe Rajini can act, and like him only as a superhero. Rajinikant reminds me of Gail Wynand, a character created by Ayn Rand in her 'The Fountainhead'. He just gives people what they want. You can't blame him for it. You don't start from scratch and build such a reputation just to throw it away so that you can experiment. But, people are fickle-minded, and they wishes can not be fulfilled for ever. Rajini is now too old to adapt once again from the beginning. It is a pity that we were not able to see more of his acting. I only hope that his last film would be one where he proves he can act too. About Rajini as a person, I think much has been said about it already. Rahul Dravid - 'The Wall', 'Mr.Consistent', 'Mr.Dependable' and 'Jammy'. Recently, when he was asked to double up as a commentator as well as a fielder for RCB, he was asked what he was doing in the outfield. He simply replied he had to stand there, since one could hide themselves in the slip-cordon throughout a match only in test cricket. As Harsha Bhogle later pointed out, this was from the man who has the highest number of catches in test cricket. When selected for the ODI team recently, he didn't say a word to anyone. A few days later, I read somewhere that he was the only person seen practicing at the NCA on The Independence day. I can go on talking about his performances, but that would be a waste of time since no one will disagree with me. I will just say that any great player like him, Sachin, Laxman, Ponting can adapt easily to any format of the game. I hope that he is given a chance to retire from limited overs cricket in a way that would be etched in our memories.\nFrankly speaking, I don't watch much Tennis. I know just enough to realise that Federer is greatness personified, and we shouldn't miss the opportunity to watch greatness at work. These three may seem to be an odd combination. Two sportsmen, and one actor - not the perfect choice for role models. But, there are some similarities between them. The first one that I noticed that was that all the three have names started from 'R'. I started scouting for celebrities whose names start from the same letter, and you can imagine my happiness when Mr.T.Rajendar changed his name to Vijaya T.Rajendar! But more importantly, none of them has been carried away by success. They are talented, witty and humble. And unfortunately, they are all past their peaks. I can't be so sure about Roger Federer, but it won't be the same for him anymore.\nMaybe it is becoming a general trend - time-tested theories are being ripped apart by the pressure caused due to wide-spread critisicsm, causing self-doubts. Some, like 'The Little Master' and 'Fedex' survive, only to face more critiscm. How much more can they endure?

I first got the idea of blogging when I was in class 12. That was the time when I really discovered the world of internet. I used to sign up in any social networking site that came up. That was also the time when blogging was really picking up. It took all my resistance to not join the bandwagon.\nNow, why did I resist, or rather, try to resist, so strongly? There were a number of reasons, the leading one being that, contrary to what a lot of people think about me, I am really lazy. I knew that it is easy to start a blog, but difficult to maintain it. Next, I was not brave enough to face the truth then. I knew that any piece that I wrote then would be done with the aim of pleasing the readers. The blogs would not give any more idea about me than one can deduce by observing me. Instead, it would be filled with my lame attempts at humour. And lets face it, my sense of humour while writing is so mild that people often miss it!\nSo, why am I here now? As I said before, the temptation was too much. Many of my friends have started blogging, and its high time that I really start getting my feet wet. Until now, I have always managed to stay away from actually doing something and just commenting on it. For once, let it be said that \"He did it poorly\" instead of \"He might have done it better, if only he had tried!\". More importantly, I have changed a lot in these four years. From being a typical introvert, I have started having the symptoms of an extrovert at times. I am no more afraid that people will find out what I think. I sometimes surprise people with my frankness, and then go back into my shell. I have learnt a lot more about me these 4 years, and I am ready to share atleast a part of it - of course, the harmless part! - with others. As a result, you will find this blog mostly egotistical. Most of the things that concern me wouldn't be of any value at all, and many of you will end up angry with yourself for wasting time on this. Like I mentioned earlier, I am a tad less concerned about the readers now. Whenever I get into my elements, I tend to get disorganized and branch from one topic to another, just like my mind does. In short, I venture into parts that are considered by most people as nonsense! But, a blog is meant to be different from a diary. I will keep that in mind, and try to be a little more organized. I will also try to describe any interesting incidents that I come across. And if I run out of things to write, which is certain to happen, I will try to resort to reviewing some movie, novel, or a cricket match!\nHope I have not bored you already. Comments are always welcome. Thanks a lot!\nPS: I am a little colour blind. I chose the template for this randomnly. If any of you artists find anything out of place, please point it out to me!
