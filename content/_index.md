Welcome to The Freudian Couch. I mostly write book reviews, and occassionally attempt short stories. Many, many years ago, I used to rant about life and the World. This was when life permitted me the time to do so. Maybe some day, it will grant me this luxary once again.

I have been blogging on and off since 2009, so there is a good chance that I might have written about something you like. Use the search icon on the top right to find out. And, thanks for visiting.
