Welcome to The Freudian Couch. I write about the books I read, pen stories I imagine, and record thoughts that linger. 

I've been doing this since 2009. Sometimes weekly, sometimes yearly, always when something demands to be written. If you're looking for hot takes or productivity hacks, this isn't the place. But if you want thoughtful book reviews that actually engage with the text, stories that take their time, or personal essays that portray a person with weak opinions weakly held, you might find something here.

Some favorites from the archives:
- [Mother tongues and other tongues](/2025/10/mother-tongue-other-tongues.html) - On identity and growing up multi-lingual
- [Sujatha Gidla's Ants Among Elephants](/2017/09/review-of-sujatha-gidlas-ants-among.html) - A review of Sujatha Gidla's powerful Ants Among Elephants, which made me aware of my own privilege
- [Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment](/2014/07/thoughts-on-crime-and-punishment.html) - My take on this classic and why I stop short of calling it a "must-read"
- [Nithya](/2017/07/nithya.html) Fiction: Rishi want's to grow up soon. But adulthood is not all roses, is it? 
- [Hair Experts](2017/03/hair-experts.html) On why I don't look forward to hair cuts
