>All stories are about wolves. All worth repeating, that is. Anything else is sentimental drivel.
  All of them? 
  Sure, he says. Think about it. There's escaping from the wolves, fighting the wolves, capturing  the wolves, taming the wolves. Being thrown to the wolves, or throwing others to the wolves so  that the wolves will eat them instead of you. Running with the wolf pack. Turning into a wolf.  Best of all, turning into the head wolf. No other decent stories exist. 
  I think they do, she says. I think the story about you telling me the story about wolves isn't about wolves. 

As I consciously attempt to stick to my habit of penning my thoughts books consistently, I have become apprehensive about reading a book at the end of which I am not sure what to say. It is not that *The Blind Assassin* by *Margaret Atwood* is not impactful. Quite the opposite in fact. Margaret Atwood is a writer of unquestionable craft, and *The Blind Assassin* is immersive and evocative. In fact, *The Blind Assassin* is so well written that if there are parts I did not get, it's due to my own thickheadedness. This sprawling novel had a lot of parts I did get though, and they were worth it.
