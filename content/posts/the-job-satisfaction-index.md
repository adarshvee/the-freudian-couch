Twitter, as I have already touched upon in an earlier post, is a wonderful media. One of the major reasons for twitter's success as a Social Media is its Trending Topics. It is always interesting to know what our collective conscious is thinking and discussing about, and trending topic is a great way to do just that. For instance, in the last few months, "Job Description" and "Tomorrow is Friday" were trending topics.<br />

Now, there could be&nbsp;innocuous reasons for these trending topics. Maybe "Tomorrow is Friday" was trending &nbsp; &nbsp; because people all over the country were&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">anticipating with dread the fact that they will have to stay away from work for a couple of days. But, on interacting with a sample space of around 100 people, I concluded that this was unlikely. To put is simply, people were glad to get away from work for a couple of days. And why was "Job Description" trending? Was it because people all over the country were scouting for jobs? Are so many of us dissatisfied with our jobs? As a generation, haven't we been priding ourselves on being more capable of decision making than our previous generations, and on using this decision making skills in searching for jobs we love doing? I have been of the opinion that a lot of people in this generation are earning money by following their passion. Have I been wrong in making this assumption, or was Confucius wrong when he said&nbsp;"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life"?</span></div>

<span style="background-color: white;">As I am often wont to do, let me take a detour at this point. I recently finished reading the book "Of Human Bondage" by Somerset Maugham, and the book left a deep impact on me. On another day, I would probably describe why I related so much to the book. But for now, I will describe a couple of characters from the book, and a few incidents from their lives.</span></div>

<span style="background-color: white;">Fanny Price is a conceited girl who generally hates people of all kind, and is in turn disliked by almost everyone. She has tremendous passion for art, and is signed up to an art school in Paris.Her passion for art is so extreme that she&nbsp;separates&nbsp;from her only living relative, and leads her life in abject poverty, But she had no talent in art. Here is what an expert in the art school has to say of her paintings, and her abilities :</span></div>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"Well, what do you wish me to say to you? Do you wish me to tell you it is good? It isn't. Do you wish me to tell you it is well drawn? It isn't . Do you wish me to say it has merit? It hasn't. Do you wish me to show you what is wrong with it? It is all wrong. Do you wish me to tell you what to do with it? Tear it up."</blockquote>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"'..I can't teach you. I could more easily teach a camel.' He turned to Mrs. Otter. 'Ask her, does this do this for&nbsp;amusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?'<br />
'I'm going to earn my living as an artist,' Miss Price answered.<br />
'Then it is my duty to tell you that you are wasting your time. It would not matter that you have no talent, talent does not run about the streets these days, but you have not the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;of aptitude. How long have you been here? A child of five after two lessons would draw better than you do. I only say one thing to you, give up this hopeless attempt. You're more likely to earn your living as a <i>bonne a tout faire </i>thank as a painter.. Take my advice Mademoiselle, try dressmaking.'"</blockquote>

<span style="background-color: white;">Phillip Carrey loses both his parents as a child, and lives with his uncle, who is a vicar. With the kind of childhood he is subjected to, Phillip shows all indications of a prospective parochial career, but certain events disillusion him from religion. He drops out of school to pursue foreign languages in Germany. Back to England after a couple of years, having learnt a little more than what he set out to, but still unsure about his future career, he takes the advice of his family solicitor, and interns with a chartered accountant, only to realise that he does not possess the basic arithmetic talent required for an accounting profession. After having spent an year to discover this, he decides to quit and make a career out of his hobby - painting. He enrolls in an art school in Paris, where he meets a motley set of characters, including Fanny Price. Two years of being an artist teaches him that though he is good enough to pass muster as an artist, he doesn't have the inborn talent that is a pre-requisite for greatness. He consults the same expert who brutally advised Fanny Price, and confirms that though he had it it him to become a great artist, it was more likely that he would fail. At this he 'bravely' decides that it might be foolish to pursue his passion, and abandons the idea of becoming an artist. Not left with many other options, and reaching an age where a permanent choice has to be made, he decides to take up medicine, and ends up being quite successful in it.</span><br />

If you have managed to read through everything I have written, you will be left wondering about the point I am trying to make. The whole purpose of this post is just to examine a small question that has been nagging me for the past few months - is making a career out of your passion an over-rated idea?<br />
