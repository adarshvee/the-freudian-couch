To paraphrase Manu Joseph from his book <span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://adarsh89.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-illicit-happiness-of-other-people.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">The Illicit Happiness of Other People</span></a>, </span>the problem with rational people is that they are not rational enough. The in-thing today is to be rational, liberal and socially secular. So much so that people often suppress the real opinion on things and have opinions that they believe society will love. This is more common over the internet. Boys who grew up remarking on the physical nature of every girl they came across are now feminists. People who bribed to get their license are remarking on corruption in the country. Drivers who rarely stop when a traffic signal is red remark on how Indians do not have basic road sense. Guys who throw trash on the road are insisting on cleanliness. Everyone wants freedom of expression. Man's opinion of himself is probably at the highest ever it has been in bistory. People suddenly love science. People suddenly love logic.<br />
<br />
Why am I sore at all this? Shouldn't I be happy if people change for good? I would be, if these people were consistent. I would be, if these people didn't state their opinions from a moral high ground, claiming that their's is the only right opinion. Being rational may be cool, but it is not easy. There is a whole course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/thinkagain" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Coursera</span></a>&nbsp;on using logic to state your points. There are logical traps all of us tend to fall into while stating our points. If you are calling yourself a rationalist, be mindful of these traps. I prefer the alternative, and proudly proclaim myself as an irrational animal. Here are some fallacies commited by so-called rational people.<br />
