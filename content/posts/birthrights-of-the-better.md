I occasionally wonder if flowers are overrated. "<i>It is not growing like a tree; In bulk doth make Man better be..&nbsp;A lily of a day; Is fairer far in May, Although it fall and die that nightâ€” It was the plant and flower of light. In small proportions we just beauties see</i>" wrote Ben Jonson. If my grasp of what my High school English teachers were trying explain is right, Ben Jonson seems to indicate that a short-lived lily is better than a long-standing oak because it spreads beauty and happiness. Probably due to the succinct nature of the medium Ben Jonson chose to covey his message, he did not meander on questions such as whether beauty can make people happy, or if a life that makes others happy is necessarily "better". Ben Jonson is of course not the only person to glorify flowers. Flowers are probably the most common subject for poets all around the World. Flowers look good, they smell good, and they are functionally very important for plants. But, what else?</div>
