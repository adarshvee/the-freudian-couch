If there is any doubt about the tone <i>Manu Joseph</i>'s debut novel <i>Serious Men</i> would take, the book's opening lines -- <i>"Ayyan Mani's thick black hair was combed sideways and parted by a careless broken line, like the borders the British used to draw between two hostile neighbours"</i> -- clear it up for us. Manu Joseph's wit and cynicism are in full display in Serious Men, which is set in Mumbai (<i>"the humid crowds, the great perpetual squeeze, the silent vengeance of the poor"</i>). Hidden beneath the clever one-liners is an intertwined tale of two vastly different men in dissimilar circumstances trying to break free from the stereotypes on them.</div>

<i>Ayyan Mani</i> is a son of a sweeper, a Dalit - among the lowest of castes in Indian caste hierarchy. He is extremely well versed in the ways of the World, deeply cynical, and is capable of getting things done. His anger is Manu Joseph's anger, his perversions are our perversions. However he is not where he wants to be in his life, and he has a strong sense that this is due to his caste. <i>"If you only had the fathers that these men had, you would have had a room of your own today with your own secretary"</i>, a character tells him, and one can only agree. Ayyan Mani lives with his wife <i>Oja</i> and 11-year old son <i>Adi</i> in a densely populated tenement for the poor. <i>"In a way, this was the easiest place to be a man. To be alive was enough. To be sober and employed was fantastically impressive. Ayyan Mani was something of a legend"</i>. Ayyan Mani has one opportunity to use his cruel sense of humour and get back at the World. The risks are immense, especially to his partially deaf son Adi. But Ayyan senses that he may not be able to stop himself before it is too late.</div>

<i>Arvind Acharya</i> is the director of Indian Institute of Theory and Research. He is a Tamil Brahmin, and has a <i>"newsworthy rage and tragic brilliance"</i>. Tall, good looking, arrogant, incisive, but past his prime. His reputation is spotless, and his words carry respect through-out the scientific community everywhere. Acharya is not a man bothered with the practicalities of the World, and he is in pursuit of higher truths (whereas Ayyan believes that there is <i>"no such thing as truth."</i> There is <i>"only pursuit of truth and it was a pursuit that would always go on. It was a form of employment"</i>). He loves his wife <i>Lavanya</i> in the per-functionary way a couple whose marriage has been arranged love each other. He laments that scientists are more focused at research in <i>"time reversal, black holes, dark matter, dark energy, invisibility, intelligent civilisations"</i>, or what he terms as <i>"Exciting rubbish"</i>. He has his own eccentric theories on life. However he faces an institutional opposition, and a threat to his own sense of morality.</div>

Having read Manu Joseph's <i>The Illicit Happiness of Other People</i> earlier (review <a href="http://adarsh89.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-illicit-happiness-of-other-people.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: blue;">here</span></a>), I felt that there are some commonalities in his work. A bit of science in the plot, and a memory that cannot be explained away by Science; a random set of facts that are memorized and repeated; a disregard for male friendships (<i>"That men, in reality, did not have friends in other men"</i> in Serious Men and <i>"that any two men in the world have real affection between them is itself a myth, chiefly of the two men"</i> in the Illicit Happiness of Other People) and much more. Needless to say, I enjoyed both his works thoroughly. Serious Men is largely funny, and is littered with unexpectedly poignant moments. Manu Joseph is the ultimate troll, and he is endurable because his wrath is not directed towards a single idealogy or group of people. Dalits, Brahmins, Christians, Tamils (<i>"Most Tamilians so tiny and genetically predisposed to believing something is wrong with others"</i>), the rich (<i>"Rich people have a name for everything. They even have word for the time a man spends with his family.. they call it 'Quality Time'"</i>), the poor, the random motorist (<i>"After riding like a moron all over the place, observe the face of an Indian when he crashes. He is stunned."</i>), the educated and the irresponsible - no one is safe from Manu Joseph's vitriol. In my review of <i>The Illicit Happiness of Other People</i>, I had compared him with Oscar Wilde and written that <i>"he throws up aphorisms which sound attractive but are not necessarily true"</i>. The same pattern is evident in Serious Men too, which is littered with witty one-liners such as <i>"The fate of every love story, he knew very well, is in the rot of togetherness, or in the misery of separation"</i> which are not falsifiable. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The only discernible downside is that the conclusion of Serious Men seems a bit forced, with some filmy moments. This is exactly what I felt about the conclusion of <i>"The Illicit Happiness.. "</i> too. But once again, I see that there are not many logical ways the plot could have ended. The supporting characters are all caricatures, and this contributes immensely to the humour. I enjoyed the simple-mindedness of Oja, who keeps throwing folk sayings such as <i>"the end of an ox is beef, the end of a lie is grief"</i>. Serious Men is a worthy read, especially for privileged Indians (such as me) who wish to know how easy things have been for them.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I remain a fan of Manu Joseph, both his fictional works and his weekly columns.
