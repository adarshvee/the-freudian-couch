On a typical work day, I conceived yet another article for My Faking News, consisting of a lot of exaggerations, distortions of truth, some stereotyping, and a few lame attempts at joke-making. The article features Shakeseare, Dr.Harsh Vardhan, and Lord Krishna. Please read, and do the needful.&nbsp;<a href="http://my.fakingnews.firstpost.com/2014/07/03/man-hospitalized-after-showing-real-passion-towards-work/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Man hospitalized after showing real passion towards work</span></a></div>

Apart from being one of my shortest posts, it is also one of my quickest.

Glad that I was able to convey atleast part of that idea, without my usual seriousness.</div>

Here is the link to that article :&nbsp;<a href="http://my.fakingnews.firstpost.com/2013/09/07/girl-arrested-for-checking-in-from-29-countries-while-sitting-at-home/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Girl arrested for Checking in from 29 countries while sitting at home</span></a></div>
