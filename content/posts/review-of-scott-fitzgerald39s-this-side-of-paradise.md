I picked <i>Scott Fitzgerald</i>'s <b>This Side of Paradise</b> from my local public library for two
reasons : I wanted to read a classic; and having moved to an area not far away
from Princeton, I was attracted by the blurb that indicated that a major part
of the story takes place in Princeton. It occurred to me a bit later that the
place would have changed immensely in the last century and that I might not be
able to relate to the geography after all. With Scott Fitzgerald's
semi-autobiographical debut novel set in early 20th century, not only was I not
able to relate to the place, I was not able to relate to the characters too for
the most part of the book.</div>

This Side of Paradise is the coming-of-age story of Amory
Blaine. Amory's father is dismissed off quickly as "<i>an ineffectual,
inarticulate man</i>". We learn that Amory takes after his mother ("<i>But
Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman!</i>"). Beatrice comes from an European
family of wealth, and ensures that for a good part of Amory's life, he does not
have to worry about petty things such as money. She treats her son in a way we
could only envy, with advice such as "<i>dear, don't think of getting out of
bed yet. I've always suspected that early rising in early life makes one
nervous</i>". Amory's initial education consists of private tutoring, until he
decides to attend prep school at America. These were different times, and Amory
attends a boarding school with the grand motto "<i>To impart a Thorough
Mental, Moral, and Physical Training&nbsp; as
a Christian Gentleman, to fit the boy for meeting problems of his day and
generation, and to give a solid foundation in the Arts and Sciences</i>". His
teachers think of him as "<i>idle, unreliable and superficially clever</i>",
but he does not get the message. Amory completes school thinking highly of
himself, and with disenchantment from his first love.</div>

At Princeton University, Amory is in single minded pursuit
of his ambition to maintain a high status, as are most of his fellow students.
He discovers literature with his friends, and attempts a lot of not-so-ambitious
poetry. He is terribly self-concerned (as Fitzgerald points out, he is just a
"<i>romantic egotist</i>"). If you are a fan of such things, there are some
beautiful lines here that describe the passage of various seasons, and there
are many references to other literary works of the time. I am not, so I had
through hurry through this phase with as much disinterest as Amory had on his
studies. There are some exhilarating sequences, such as the one where a set of
students elope for an unplanned vacation and eat a lot of expensive food
without paying much. Amory, in the mean time, falls in love, and falls out of
it once again. He also comes across Monsignor Darcy, an old friend of Beatrice
and a mentor figure to Amory. Darcy is "<i>intensely ritualistic, startlingly
dramatic, loved the idea of God enough to be celibate, and rather liked his
neighbor</i>". Monsignor Darcy gives some important advice to Amory, such as
"<i>we're not personalities, but personages</i>". However Amory does not
seem to be taking much note.</div>

World War 1 intervenes, but we do read much about it.
Amory's outlook towards the war is described as "<i>the attitude he might
have held toward an amusing melodrama, he hoped it would be long and bloody. If
it had not continued he would have felt like an irate ticket holder at a
prizefight where the principals refused to mix up</i>". The whole World War
passes away as an interlude of a few pages. Amory is a changed man after the
war, or so we think. But he falls in love once again with a girl artfully
described as "<i>her philosophy is carpe diem for herself and laissez faire
for others</i>". It takes a few more episodes, and a few more flings with
various women before Amory realizes that he has run out of the considerable sum
of money he had inherited. Amory turns a new leaf, and even starts to develop an
affection to communism ("<i>However the brain and abilities of men may
differ, their stomachs are essentially the same</i>").&nbsp;</div>

<i>This Side of Paradise</i> has an unpredictable narrative, taking
the form of prose, poetry, and even drama. This in itself is extremely innovative. The writing is brilliant at times,
and let's just say that I couldn't recognize the brilliance at other times.
What kept me going was the fact that Scott Fitzgerald does not pretend that his
protagonist is a hero. The writing is self-aware, and is self-critical of
Amory's narrow-mindedness. This was after all a generation at the beginning of
a new century, a generation that was caught in a war unlike anything else
preceding it. The importance of this book, is thus, more contextual than
objective. This Side of Paradise makes more sense for students of literature
than to the lay reader.<o:p></o:p></div>
