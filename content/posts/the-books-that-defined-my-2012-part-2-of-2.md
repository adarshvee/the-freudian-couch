Whiteout<span style="font-weight: normal;"> (By Ken Follet)</span></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Ken Follet never ceases to surprise me with his mastery over multiple genres.</span> Set in Scotland, the novels initially builds like a biochemical thriller.&nbsp; Stanley Oxenford, chief of Oxenford labortories, is having a not-so-pleasant Christmas eve get-together with his daughters, their fiancees/husbands, grandchildren and his son. Toni Gallo, an ex-cop with extra-sensitive criminal instincts has her own problems as she is forced to forgo a long planned vacation to take care of her aging mother. As is required in such thrillers, there is a blizzard all over Scotland making it almost impossible to get from one place to another. There is a break-in at the highly secured Oxenford lab, with a lab technician left dead, and vials of deadly viruses being stolen. Ken Follet brings all these elements to a single mansion, where the plot is resolved.</div>

<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
The novel begins like a Robin Cookish biochemical thriller, but you will be disappointing if you expect anything of that sorts. While keeping it thrilling, Follet brings in his own characteristic elements in the plot, like a teenager with a point to prove to his grown ups, an adulterous husband, an angry son, couple of blooming romances. With a little bit of humour thrown in, the author concentrates more on the human elements of the situation than making it an edge of the seat thriller</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Verdict</b> : It does use a few formula elements of certain other Ken Follet thrillers (like Night Over Water, Eye of the Needle), but it is a pretty good light read.&nbsp;</div>

Oliver's Story<span style="font-weight: normal;"> (By Erich Segal)</span></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Before I begin, I must warn you that this is a sequel to the author's more famous "Love Story". Having borrowed the book from a library without realising this, I now have to contend with the fact I now know the climax of Love Story without having read it. Oliver's Story is simply a story of the hero in search of love. I wouldn't have related to most of the book, had it not been written in Erich Segal's wonderful style. I will stop at that as I am not sure I can stop myself from giving away the (wafer-thin) plot away.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Verdict</b> : If you have read Love Story and liked it, go for this one.</div>

<b>The Hobbit </b><span style="font-weight: normal;">(J.R.R. Tolkien)</span></h3>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Having read the Lord of the Rings about 7 years back, I am still trying to figure out what took me so long to read The Hobbit. As anyone who has read LOTR knows, The Hobbit is about the adventures of Bilbo Baggins.&nbsp; The Hobbit was written before the author went on to write the epic LOTR, and it is evident from the book. Bilbo Baggin's tale is much less darker than Frodo's. Only the admirable (and simultaneously loathable) Gollum gives an hint of the darkness to follow. Sprinkled with a liberal dose of Tolkein's wonderful poetry, The Hobbit is a pleasant, short and enjoyable read.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Verdict</b> : Along with The Lord of The Rings, it is a must read.&nbsp;</div>

God Save the Dork : The Incredible International Adventures of Robert 'Einstein' Varghese <span style="font-weight: normal;">(By Sidin Vadukut) </span></h3>
<div>
This book is a sequel for the hilarious <i>Dork : The Incredible Adventures of Robert 'Einstein' Varghese </i>by Sidin. I picked up this book only after the third&nbsp;installment in the trilogy was released, and got good reviews. Frankly, the second installment is quite boring. There are occasional flashes of brilliant humour, both most of the book is predictable, and the good jokes are few and far between. I would still go on to read the final book of the trilogy.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Verdict : </b>There is no use reading this particular book unless you are going to read the whole "Dork" series. As far as the whole series is concerned, it is definitely worth a read.</div>
