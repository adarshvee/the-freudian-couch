<div style="text-align: justify;">
It must have been during the third year of our Engineering course. Like most typical Indian under-graduation course, ours too was in the danger of contributing not many things to our life. It is not the fault of the system - I will have the authority to blame the system only if I had extracted everything I could from it, and had found that the system had nothing more to offer to me. Before I go into a philosophical mode, let me try getting back to the point.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Some of my friends were keen to make use of the cultural <a href="http://www.kuruksastra.org/2012/index.php">event</a> held at our college. We were aiming for the ad-zap event, but the posters of the Photography and Videography events held our attention longer that they ought to have, considering that we didn't even have a 5 MP digital camera with us. But it did, and the rest, as they say, is History.Forgotten history is History too, isn't it?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We went on to make a first "short-film" despite many hurdles. As expected, it failed miserably. This didn't deter us, and we went on to make a second "short-film", which failed too. But, the fun we had while making these films were immense, and it made us appreciate the difficulties in making a full length feature film. I might write about the actual experiences in a later blog post. For now, I have decided to post the scripts written by me for these two movies.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
A little about the script, before I actually paste it here. The story's ending is a conscious rehash of a Hindi <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195002/">movie</a> that I had seen as a child and had a profoundly effect on me (just discovered that it is written and directed by two very famous people). The underlying situation is from a <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/921796.We_ll_Share_a_Double_Funeral">novel</a> by one my my all time favorite authors. So, here is the script.</div>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u> TITLE - The Intruder</u></b><br />
<br />
<u>Scene 1 </u>- Dark Ext <br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Focus on a compound wall.&nbsp; A person (man 1) jumps over the wall from the other side. He carries a packed bag with him. Focus on him for some time as he runs through the street.</div>
<br />
<u>Scene 2</u> - Dark Ext<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Focus on the gate of an individual house. Man 1 comes running from outside, enters the gate, and goes towards the door. He pants, as he bangs the door twice and moves aside. </div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
The door opens, a man (Man 2) peeps out of the door without opening the door. Finding no one, he opens the door fully. Man 1, who was hiding beside the door jumps out&nbsp; suddenly and points a gun towards Man 2.</div>
<br />
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
Man 1: Don’t make a noise, this thing works.&nbsp; Just do as I say.</div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 2 looks startled, but recovers quickly. He nods his head and says..</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
Man 2: I will do as you say, please don’t shoot.</div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 points inside the house. Man 2 nods and moves slowly enters. Man 1 follows him closing the door. His eyes and the gun never leave the other person.</div>
<br />
<u>Scene 3- Int</u><br />
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
Man 2: Who are you? You can take whatever you want, but don’t hurt me.</div>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Man 1: I am already rich</span> <span style="color: #0b5394;">(nods towards the bag in his hand, out of which one or two jewels are visible from outside)</span>. <br />
Man 2: Then why are you here? <br />
<span style="color: #0b5394;">He waits for an answer, but doesn’t get any. Instead, sounds of the door knocking are heard again. Man 2 looks questioningly at Man 1. Man 1 gets tensed up.</span><br />
Man 1: <span style="color: #0b5394;">(whispering)</span> Open the door slightly, and send whoever is there back. One wrong move and your head will be punctured. <br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 2 nods, and walks towards the door.&nbsp; Man 1 follows him, with the gun kept pointed. He stands on one side of the door. Man 2 opens the door a little, and peeps out.</div>
<br />
<u>Scene 3</u>&nbsp; - Int, Ext<br />
Man 2: <span style="color: #0b5394;">(his voice filled a little fake anger)</span> who is it?<br />
Man: Did you hear someone come this side? There’s been a theft.<br />
Man 2: <span style="color: #0b5394;">(softens his tone a little)</span> No, I didn’t hear anything. Where did it happen?<br />
Man: In the next street. Keep your doors locked. Call the police if you see or hear anything suspicious.<br />
Man 2: Sure.<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
The man leaves the house and Man 2 looks at Man 1 for approval. Man 1 relaxes a little, and Man 2 walks slowly towards the centre of the hall.</div>
Man 1 places his bag down. They remain standing for some time. Man 1 suddenly realises this. <br />
Man 2:<span style="color: #0b5394;"> (points towards a chair)</span> Mind if I sit down?<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 gives an unsure look. Man 2 makes use of this pause and pulls a chair. </div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 remains standing for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought says..</div>
Man 1: Do you have a cell phone? <span style="color: #0b5394;">(Man 2 nods his head)</span> Take it out slowly (he reemphasises the presence of the gun), switch it off and give it to me? <span style="color: #0b5394;">(Raises his voice a little)</span> Understand?<br />
Man 2: Yeah. I used to do this often in my college.<span style="color: #0b5394;"> (He follows the instructions)</span><br />
Man 1: Landline?<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 2 nods his head to indicate no. Man 1 confirms by looking around, spots another chair. He hesitates, and then he pulls a chair too.</div>
The clock shows 12:25. Fade away.<br />
<br />
<u>Scene 4</u> - Int<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
The clock shows 12:40. Man 2 is calm but restless. Man 1 is restless too, and tensed. </div>
Man 2: Shall I switch on the T.V.?<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 thinks for a moment, and then nods. Man 2 switches on the T.V. using the remote, and offers the remote to Man 1. He shrugs as Man 1 refuses, and starts surfing the channels. As the camera moves backward, sound of different songs, advertisements are heard. Finally, the sound settles down at some cricket commentary.</div>
<br />
<u>Scene 5 - Int</u> <br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
The clock shows 12:55</div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Both of them seem to be engrossed in the match. Man 1 still keeps his gun clutched tightly. </div>
Man 2: This man seems have a lot of luck. It will leave him soon though.<br />
Man 1: Dhoni is a great captain.<br />
Man 2: <span style="color: #0b5394;">(Laughs sarcastically)</span> He is not as good as they claim.<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 suddenly gets up, pushes the gun towards the other person and repeats his words.</div>
Man 2:<span style="color: #0b5394;"> (Looks startled for a moment)</span> Sorry, sorry, Dhoni is the greatest captain we have ever had!<br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 realises he is standing, and takes his seat again.</div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
<u><span style="color: black;"><br /></span></u></div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
<u><span style="color: black;">Filler</span></u> </div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
The clock shows different times, and the two people are shown sitting in the same positions, with slight modifications.</div>
<br />
<u>Scene 6 - Int</u> <br />
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
The clock shows 01:05.</div>
<div style="color: #0b5394;">
Man 1 is sitting in a more relaxed posture. Man 2 sits casually, but seems a little restless. He keeps looking at the clock. Both are munching something (maybe biscuits). Suddenly a sound is heard outside. Man 1 looks towards the direction of the sound. Man 2 lunges towards him. The camera shifts to some stationary point nearby. Muffled sounds of a struggle are heard, and finally a muffled shout is heard. Camera shifts towards the centre. Man 1, is lying down, looks dead. Man 2 stands with a bloody knife in his hands. He looks around, puts the knife down. The horn (the same sound that was heard first) rings again in a kind of a signal. He looks around again, spots the bag carried by Man 1. He picks it up, and picks another bag lying in a corner. He walks slowly towards the door, gives one last look around the hall, and walks out, closing the door behind him. Outside, a person with a helmet is waiting in a bike. Man 2 walks towards him, says something like you are late, and sits behind. The bike moves away from the house. The camera enters the house again, and goes into a inner room. The camera focuses on a second dead body (say, of Man 3) lies, covered with a blanket. Only his face is visible. The camera moves towards the wall, where a framed photo of the dead man hangs. The camera focuses again on the dead man and freezes.</div>

<div style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: black;">A few noteworthy points</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: black;">1) This is not how you write a standard script. There are certain conventions followed while writing a script, and there are special considerations to be made. Hopefully, what I have written is at least</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: black;">readable&nbsp;</span> </div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;">
2) If the script looks like crap, the actual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkOScmpG3_w">movie</a> we made is even crappier and amateurish. we borrowed a camera, and thought ourselves to hold it. We had no idea where the light sources should be while capturing a scene. After instructing my friends acting in the movie to enact each scene as slowly as they could, we ended up with a 15 minute video. Realising that the contest allowed a maximum screening time of 3 minutes, we ended up deleting most of the scenes we shot, and running the rest at a higher speed. We downloaded an editing software from the internet and learnt to use it, and used it, in just 2 days.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;">
3) Watch out for a fleeting performance by self (Yeah, I know. The video by itself is fleeting, and that's how long it will stay in your mind when you end watching it).</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;">
4) I will end this post with the tragic announcement that the second script I wrote will be up on the blog in two days ( the two day gap is for effect). It is a fantasy with what I hope to a dose of humour I would have been proud of it, if I had written it while I was fourteen, and got it published in&nbsp; a school magazine. But as they say, better late than never :)</div>
