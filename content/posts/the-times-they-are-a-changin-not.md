Before we proceed, I insist that we get a &nbsp;little thing out &nbsp;of our way. It is a journalistic trend these days to have titles that have no relevance to the content of an article. The sole aim of the title is to grab the attention of a reader, making him click a link and urging him to read on. In defense of journalists, the headlines are usually decided by editors, and journalists themselves have little say in them. In a blog post though, I feel it is necessary to take sole responsibility and just-in-case-complete-blame, something akin to an anticipatory bail, if you happen feel that the title is misleading. I first discovered the Bob Dylan song "The Times They Are A-Changin'" while watching the movie Watchmen. Despite the fact that I couldn't make out the lyrics, the song had such an impact on me that I went on to love the movie without even completely understanding it. As a compensation for people who will soon discover that this blog post is distinctly unfunny and not to their taste, here is something that might make your time worthwhile.</div>

We are far more cooler than the older generation. There is a lot of independence all around, and a belief that one is responsible for one's own happiness. The past generations were largely bound by societal conventions, and their own passions took a &nbsp;backstage. For our generation, an individual's desires and wants take centre stage, and everything else is just supplementary. A "Where do you work?" is almost always followed by "do you like it?".</div>
