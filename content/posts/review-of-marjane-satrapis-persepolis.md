<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">It is hard to classify <b><i>Marjane Satrapi</i></b>’s <b><i>Persepolis</i></b>. The medium is <i>Bande_dessinée</i> – a French precursor of what English readers would come to term as the graphic novel. But this is not a novel, it is a memoir of a teenager growing up in tumultuous times in Iran.

Marjane Satrapi’s narration starts during the Iranian revolution which ultimately led to the overthrow of Iran’s last Shah belonging to the house of <i>Pahlavi</i>. We then go into a brief flashback to get introduced to Satrapi as a kid, her parents, and her grandmother. Marjane Satrapi grows up in an upper middle class household which is not particularly religious, and her writing has a sparkling sense of humor, conveyed both through her words and illustration. There is profundity, but Satrapi does not dwell on it.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhU0y1v5Atanv6M_NKmVNnuS5ZorVYZUIUAjI2FMFFe2rLAKJaHzdmWRIXCaNNcjlCa6OBtJlWJySd5uNfilwtubdji97M-Ppsmh_sC2Lc7ULn2grI3wK4DxQzGaLH2cT9dURBOiZNLiRyb/s2379/PXL_20211207_020608907.MP.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1849" data-original-width="2379" height="249" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhU0y1v5Atanv6M_NKmVNnuS5ZorVYZUIUAjI2FMFFe2rLAKJaHzdmWRIXCaNNcjlCa6OBtJlWJySd5uNfilwtubdji97M-Ppsmh_sC2Lc7ULn2grI3wK4DxQzGaLH2cT9dURBOiZNLiRyb/s320/PXL_20211207_020608907.MP.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia;">Satrapi, as many great writers, grows up with books.

The Pahlavi dynasty is installed by means of a coup d'tat supported by the U.S.A. and the British government against a democratically elected leader. Why? Well, oil.

Though the Satrapi family believe firmly that the Shah was responsible for this incident, there is no historical agreement on this fact. Ultimately, the Shah is exiled, and takes refuge in Egypt as the Western powers -- Jimmy Carter being at the stewardship of the U.S.A. -- lose interest in him.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.2px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.2px; white-space: pre-wrap;">However, the joy is short lived as Ayatollah </span><span style="color: #202124;"><span style="font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.2px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ruhollah Khomeini takes over the reins, and Islamic conservatism becomes mainstream.

Iran soon get into a war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and we witness the impact of this war first hand, until Satrapi is sent to Austria for continuing her studies.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">This is an eventful book, and Satrapi is forced to pack a bunch of information in an unusual format. Despite this, she keeps the tone light and does not lose focus on the wishes and desires of an adolescent girl. It is worth re-emphasizing that Marjane Satrapi has a terrific sense of humor, sometimes of the gallows kind. She attributes this to the Persian outlook of life shaped by generations living in a historically turbulent region.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUeCuDM6TGkwWAJtIlPaa9zOfQe8ca4Ma_KTM3aQFUf1ILZHcvM6e9_OCE_XuKv9IPK2ryEqTQI6ZPUPj_zMQnT8YCwwxVlklAqv1kuftoFUzE1Zo_VeqqqPNcRSy_OdJ_mITduAztaARj/s1977/PXL_20211207_175538159.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1977" data-original-width="1443" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUeCuDM6TGkwWAJtIlPaa9zOfQe8ca4Ma_KTM3aQFUf1ILZHcvM6e9_OCE_XuKv9IPK2ryEqTQI6ZPUPj_zMQnT8YCwwxVlklAqv1kuftoFUzE1Zo_VeqqqPNcRSy_OdJ_mITduAztaARj/s320/PXL_20211207_175538159.jpg" width="234" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">However, this lightness of tone was the first problem with Persepolis for me. This book is targeted primarily at adolescent readers as an introduction to the complexity, and also relatability (for people are the same everywhere), of life in Iran. Reading this as an adult, I feel a desire to know more about the events and incidents hinted by her. The second problem, if I may call it that, is the background of the Satrapi family, which admittedly only in some small ways, protects them from the most tragic aspects of war and revolution. This is not something that the author could control, and certainly not something that invalidates her experience of living in Iran. The solution to both these problems lie simply in me exploring more about Iran and the history of the middle east, and reading first hand accounts from many different perspectives.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: georgia;">Persepolis does not lack profundity, and my favorite fragment is this line uttered against nationalist fervor :</span></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPRVI_0EgWrdeWYcIKCzsJ0xRiLaUVh2vXm3o0ivE3RU5cpFtbPkxQCXKkmj9aL9DymqtxXSguWqhCxqeyUHNIDSwXeKQn8tetzQzOU8Eqfqyu4YRHsBdtJrUe5ElwyPGI6vVoVNVDV5IM/s3106/PXL_20211207_184102777.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2024" data-original-width="3106" height="209" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPRVI_0EgWrdeWYcIKCzsJ0xRiLaUVh2vXm3o0ivE3RU5cpFtbPkxQCXKkmj9aL9DymqtxXSguWqhCxqeyUHNIDSwXeKQn8tetzQzOU8Eqfqyu4YRHsBdtJrUe5ElwyPGI6vVoVNVDV5IM/s320/PXL_20211207_184102777.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div>
