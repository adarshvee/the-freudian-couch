<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Going by various new reports, the
Karnataka government seems to have asked taxi aggregators such as Uber and Ola
to stop/halt services. As with most recent incidents (and non-incidents) in
India, going through various news articles makes one clueless as to what is
really transpiring in Karnataka.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://thetechportal.in/2016/05/29/cab-aggregators-asked-cease-operations/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Here</span></a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>is one
news article explaining that Karnataka has banned "unlicensed" cabs.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/karnataka-to-uber-ola-get-licence-or-go-off-roads-116052900074_1.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Business Standard</span></a>&nbsp;suggests that services have only
been suspended. <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/bangalore-news/follow-rules-or-stay-off-roads-bengaluru-government-tells-uber-ola-1413541" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">NDTV</span></a> talks about rumours that Ola and Uber are banned, and
explains that the "truth is somewhat different". Apparently, the
Karnataka Government has laid down certain regulations to be followed by all
taxi services, and Uber and Ola are yet to agree to these regulations. The
regulations include control over the maximum pricing (thereby ending surge
pricing).&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Meanwhile, the internet has started to
react. Going through a few set of tweets, people are unanimous in supporting
cab services against the state's congress Government. The reasoning is simple :
Uber and Ola have achieved what Governments around the country haven't been
able to - make transport convenient and easy. There is no point tinkering with
something that is already so useful to people, possibly making it inconvenient.
Why should Government regulate the prices of cabs, if people are willing to
pay? Why is regulation even needed in a free market? Swarajya magazine, a
famous right wing online news analyzer, has written a detailed<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://swarajyamag.com/columns/read-to-believe-why-karnataka-govt-has-asked-ola-and-uber-to-halt-operations" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">response</span></a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>on
why the Government is wrong. Remarkably, the article is triggered by a single<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ETNOWlive/status/736586226879201280" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">tweet</span></a>&nbsp;by
Economic times. There are also arguments on how this move by the Government
would affect the employment of about 50000 drivers. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">I have started using Uber and Ola quite
recently, and find them extremely useful. I am also fully aware of the
theoretical merits of free market. However, I would like to play the devil's
advocate here, and explore why the Government is probably not too wrong. I do
not have any facts in my hand, and I am no expert on any of the topics at hand.
My intelligence is moderate is best, and so is my articulation. To put it in a
nutshell, I could very well be completely, hopelessly wrong. However, this
seems to be the case with most journalists and opinion piece writers in the
country today. So, here is my take :<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">1)&nbsp;The Hindu had a couple of articles
last week on how Ola and Uber are making survival difficult for <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/appbased-cab-services-pose-threat-to-local-taxi-companies/article8665573.ece" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">traditional cab operators</span></a> and <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/auto-drivers-bear-the-burnt-of-summer/article8665572.ece?utm_source=InternalRef&amp;utm_medium=relatedNews&amp;utm_campaign=RelatedNews" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">auto drivers</span></a>. A traditional cab operator usually charges per six hours, and it is a disadvantage to use these cabs for a short one way trip. With the mileage an auto gives, no auto driver can complete with these app-based taxi services</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">2) Did you just say, "So what? They
deserve it for fleecing customers, and for not being flexible"? Saying all auto drivers fleece customers is a broad, and incorrect, generalization. The app based taxi services are funded by Venture Capitalists, and they can afford to provide cheap rides. I am not sure if they will continue providing the cheap rides when they have no&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18px;">competition</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">. The well-known taxi service "Fasttrack" has already been destroyed by the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18px;">aggressively</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">&nbsp;cheap VC funded "start-ups". It won't be long before they raze away other&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18px;">competitors</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">. When that happens, we the consumers would not be left with much choice. After all, isn't choice an important benefit of free-markets?<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">3) Going out today is a night-mare. As more and more people are buying car, traffic is becoming a nightmare in most India cities, with a lot of single passengers using their own car. Add to this the multitude of Ola drivers, continuously starring at their mobiles looking for the next ride, causing chaos. The cheap rates also prompt a lot of people who would otherwise use public transport to prefer private cabs. Of course I understand that I may be coming of as an spoiled elite not wanting the economically less fortunate sections of the society to avail to comforts. But it must be acknowledged that a large part of the traffic in cities like Chennai and Bangalore is made up of Ola and Uber cabs.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">4) I know someone who booked was travelling to Delhi to get married and booked an early morning Ola cab to airport. The driver never came, the helplines didn't work, and they missed the flight. The groom then drove his private car to the airport, and booked another set of tickets. The total cost was more than Rs. 35000. Having heard about this incident, I am grateful to a local travels serving our family regularly for about fifteen years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">5) Show me a Ola cab driver who follows to road rules, and I will buy you a nice and expensive book and post it to your address. I am not blaming the drivers, for their terms of employment encourages them to jump a couple of signals, and shift lanes dangerously. For instance, a driver operating under Ola micro (Rs 6/km) gets a handsome incentive when they do 15 rides a day. The per KM is so low however that the only way a driver can make profit is by taking 15 rides a day and getting the incentive. This encourages them to drive rashly.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">6) And to be non-ethical, and to stretch themselves. Once an ola driver mentioned to us that he was in his fourth ride, and if we have the app installed in a second phone, can we break our journey into two&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18px;">separate</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">&nbsp;rides from two apps? That way we would reach our destination&nbsp;and he would be taking two rides instead of one. There was an article last week on an Uber driver who was so sleep deprived that the customer on a late night ride had to <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cabbie-dozes-off-customer-takes-wheel/article8628050.ece" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">drive the cab home</span></a>. If you think this is an one-off incident, read </span><a href="http://nypost.com/2016/04/05/uber-passenger-takes-sleeping-driver-on-high-speed-chase-cops/" style="font-size: 13.5pt;" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">this</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">7) One of the most frequent arguement for app based taxi services is that it provides employment for so many people. It does, undeniably. But are these employees treated well? Uber and Ola drivers are not employees as such, and do not come under the purview of laws that ensure that drivers are treated well. There is no restriction on the number of hours they can work. <a href="http://qz.com/660085/stuck-in-bengalurus-insane-traffic-uber-and-ola-drivers-are-losing-their-incomes-and-health/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Here</span></a> is one nice article on the how Uber and Ola drivers are in danger of multiple health issues.</span></div>

<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">&nbsp;8) How transparent do you think are the app based&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18px;">aggregates?</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></div>
