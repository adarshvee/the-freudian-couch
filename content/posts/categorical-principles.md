I came across <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/441040/bollywood-roundtable-masand-talks-to-the-finest-actress-of-2013.html" target="_blank">this</a> Bollywood roundtable a few months back, where a few actresses get together for an informal chat on various things. It is quite enjoyable, as the actresses (Vidya Balan, Deepika Padukone, Kangna Ranaut and Nimrat Kaur) answer questions frankly, and with an excellent sense of humour. If you are a Bollywood fan, &nbsp;recommend that you watch this video. I rarely watch Bollywood movies, but I still found this very enjoyable and engaging.<br />
<br />
I have recently come to realise that the modern World is a busy place to be in. This might not be news to you, but for someone like me, it is a staggering shock when I realise that people have things to do. On another day, I might try to convince you that since the Universe is continuously expanding, and since everything in it is going to be destroyed one fine day, there is no real point in doing things. But, err, what's the point? Instead, I am trying to come to terms with the fact that some of you might not have the time to sit through a 40 minutes video (you don't have time and you are reading this? Hehehe!!), let me call draw your attention to an one minutes segment in that video. Now, please watch the video for a couple of minutes from 36:00. Go on, I insist.<br />
<br />
One thing that is striking about the whole video is how well all these actresses get together. Media has often led us to believe that women, that too in a high-ego profession like acting, can seldom get together. But these four ladies seem to be mocking us all for holding any such view. The only minor piece of disagreement comes at minute 36, when Rajiv Masand puts in the question, "have you ever signed a movie just for the money?". Deepika replies with an immediete "Never!", while Kangna is nodding her head saying "Yes!".<br />
