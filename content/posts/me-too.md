Well, I have succumbed to my temptation. I first got the idea of blogging when I was in class 12. That was the time when I really discovered the world of internet. I used to sign up in any social networking site that came up. That was also the time when blogging was really picking up. It took all my resistance to not join the bandwagon.<br />
<br />
Now, why did I resist, or rather, try to resist, so strongly? There were a number of reasons, the leading one being that, contrary to what a lot of people think about me, I am really lazy. I knew that it is easy to start a blog, but difficult to maintain it. Next, I was not brave enough to face the truth then. I knew that any piece that I wrote then would be done with the aim of pleasing the readers. The blogs would not give any more idea about me than one can deduce by observing me. Instead, it would be filled with my lame attempts at humour. And lets face it, my sense of humour while writing is so mild that people often miss it!<br />
<br />
So, why am I here now? As I said before, the temptation was too much. Many of my friends have started blogging, and its high time that I really start getting my feet wet. Until now, I have always managed to stay away from actually doing something and just commenting on it. For once, let it be said that "He did it poorly" instead of "He might have done it better, if only he had tried!". <br />
<br />
More importantly, I have changed a lot in these four years. From being a typical introvert, I have started having the symptoms of an extrovert at times. I am no more afraid that people will find out what I think. I sometimes surprise people with my frankness, and then go back into my shell. I have learnt a lot more about me these 4 years, and I am ready to share atleast a part of it - of course, the harmless part! - with others. As a result, you will find this blog mostly egotistical. Most of the things that concern me wouldn't be of any value at all, and many of you will end up angry with yourself for wasting time on this. <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned earlier, I am a tad less concerned about the readers now. Whenever I get into my elements, I tend to get disorganized and branch from one topic to another, just like my mind does. In short, I venture into parts that are considered by most people as nonsense! But, a blog is meant to be different from a diary. I will keep that in mind, and try to be a little more organized. I will also try to describe any interesting incidents that I come across. And if I run out of things to write, which is certain to happen, I will try to resort to reviewing some movie, novel, or a cricket match!<br />
<br />
Hope I have not bored you already. Comments are always welcome. Thanks a lot!<br />
