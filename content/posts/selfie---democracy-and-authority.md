Hi Adarsh! How are you doing?<br />
Hey man, Adarsh! How do you do?<br />
Hmm, okay-ish. It's been really long since we talked like this.<br />
Yeah, it's been some time. But what to do? One must earn. "If you can dream -- and not make dreams your master, If you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim.. Yours is the Earth" and all that.<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Sigh! That is the only line in that poem I don't like agreeing with. You know what? We get to converse so rarely these days. We must do something to preserve these occasions. Probably a snapshot or something? Let's call them selfies!</div>
Why not? Everyone does it. We are no lesser than anyone, and we are no better. We are as narcissistic as the other person. Or, are we more?<br />
More, I think. Much, much more. So, what have you been upto?<br />
I was planning to write a blog post on the now-famous AIB roast..<br />
Whoa! It was great fun, right?<br />
Uhmm, yeah. It was fun. Occasionally.<br />
So, what happened to this post?<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The same thing that happens to millions of my posts. I got bored midway. I was apprehensive of looking too conservative. I didn't think it was worthy enough. I didn't have enough time. I was too lazy. And I was distracted as one thing led to another and I ended up contemplating on democracy.</div>
Democracy? From politically incorrect jokes to political theories. That's quite a leap! There are times when I feel you could do with a good doctor. So, what about democracy?<br />
How would you define democracy?<br />
Well, I get to have an impact on how the Government is formed. And I have a lot of freedom to do what I want, as long as I don't hurt others.<br />
You are talking about representative democracy. And yet, technically, the term democracy does not guarantee freedom. It offers political freedom, perhaps. But not necessarily other forms of freedom. Almost all &nbsp;modern forms of governing people is utilitarian. They look towards the greatest good for the largest number of people.<br />
Hmm. But is freedom and the greatest good mutually exclusive?<br />
Almost always. You talked about "hurting" others. People could always claim they are hurt by what you say, what you eat, what you wear and what not!<br />
If only we could quantify hurt! The "greatest good" does sound dangerous in a way.<br />
Yes, utilitarianism has slowly seeped completely in our thoughts. Countries encourage soldiers to die for the country. Corporates routinely crush the hopes of many individuals, but people are okay with it, claiming that in the "longer run", it does a lot of good. Our heros are ones who put their lives at risk for others.<br />
True true. I am reminded of the blockbuster Interstellar, where a guy's separation from his daughter is justified, since it is for the sake of humanity. But don't you think such unselfish people have made our lives a lot better?<br />
Sure they have. If not better, at least more comfortable. But if my life were to be sacrificed for the "progress of humanity", I am not sure if I would readily agree.<br />
I can relate to that. But isn't democracy the best choice we have?<br />
I believe people have stopped looking for a better system. And if the majority is so important, we don't even need democracy in most cases.<br />
How so?<br />
Look at the Arab spring. Political experts all over the World hailed the arrival of democracy, and expected all forms of oligarchy to end. I mean, it is more than two hundred years since the French revolution.<br />
Yeah right. Poor folks at Middle East seem to have no way out.<br />
Why "poor"? A lot of them are quiet rich. And they do not seem miss western ideals such as democracy.<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Exactly. I have wondered about it a lot! How do people get used to it? Not only the Middle East. It is true of people in China too. And hey, I heard people in North Korea are happy enough about their ruler too! Unbelievable. And not only the citizens of our country. Look at how many expats defend such countries, and even celebrate them!</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Think about it. If the majority is treated well, there is no reason to complain. If the majority is conservative, or willing to not see, or even un-see, minor morally questionable incidents around them in return for being treated well, why would anyone want a change? Revolutions happen only people have nothing left to care about, nothing to loose.</div>
When you put it that way, the majority is happy! The overall happiness of the World is increased. Can democracy could be overrated?<br />
It could very well be. We can never say. Imagine you have a lot of money, like really lot. And you don't intend to spend it on yourself. Would you directly hand it over to a group of poor people with the hope that they would make good use of it? Or would you invest it in science?<br />
I don't know. It is a tough question.<br />
What if instead of the second option, you are allowed only to either give to it poor people, or buy a lot of firecrackers and<br />
<br />
Now that you put it that way, it seems to me that minorities could get a tough bargain in democracy.<br />
Yeah, right. As long as a large number of people<br />
<br /></div>
