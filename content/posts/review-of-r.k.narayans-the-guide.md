R.K.Narayan is the direction I would like to take in my own writing. Concise, clear and unobtrusive language that tells simple, timeless stories. In <i>The Guide</i>, we meet <i>Raju</i> who -- fresh from serving a two-year jail term -- is mistaken to be a wise and learned <i>sadhu</i>. This third person narrative interweaves with a first person narrative of Raju's past, where he tells us the story of his life leading to him being jailed. As the two narratives progress, we recognize that there is a pattern to everything Raju does, and that his nature makes him eternally a Guide.</div>

Raju is an instrument whose purpose is to serve other people and to give others something they lack. As he remarks, "<i>It is written on the brow of some that they shall not be left alone. I am one such</i>". This giving is literal when Raju is a shopkeeper catering to the passengers who use the <i>Malgudi </i>railway station. However it takes an abstract turn as he progresses to a guide and earns the moniker '<i>Railway Raju</i>'. His purpose now is to give information, and he does not hesitate to make them up when he is not sure. As he remarks, '<i>If I had the inclination to say "I don't know what you are talking about", my life would &nbsp;have taken a different turn</i>'. Later on, he would be required to give Rosie the freedom to enjoy her art. And finally, he is a giver of spiritual peace and comfort to the villagers around an abandoned temple. Twice, Raju deviates from his purpose and succumbs to selfish motives driven by lust and money. And he falters each time.</div>

The edition I read has an added bonus in the form of a wonderful introduction by <i>Michael Gora</i> who seems well-versed in R.K.Narayan's works. As Gora puts it, he has a "l<i>anguage that seems mastered, but not fought with</i>". The focus is always on what is happening. Physical descriptions are rare. Even when Raju lusts after Rosie, we learn less about her features than about her dancer's pose. His style is a major factor in making The Guide a gripping read. Apart from Raju; Rosie, Marco, Raju's mother are all well-etched characters. Most of R.K.Narayan's humour is derived from caricatures of other characters, especially of the society as a whole. The general public in The Guide are simpletons with hilarious quirks.</div>

Unlike many Indian novels, the tribulations this protagonist faces are his own doing. There is no effect of the prevailing political situation or macro-level factors on Raju. He is clearly born in a family that is not very well-off, as we can see from the descriptions of their simple and barely functional house. However R.K.Narayan never mentions this explicitly, and the lack of wealth in Raju's household does not limit his potential to achieve what he sets out to do. There is a school of thought that argues that this apolitical nature of fiction does not do justice to the real backdrop. Compare this style of writing with that of Salmaan Rushdie or Arundathi Roy, where the settings cause chaotic effects of the lives of the characters. In my personal opinion though, both kinds of writers are necessary, and add their own value to literature. P.G.Wodehouse wrote more than a hundred books without a political backdrop, and he even committed a political gaucherie that resulted in him being accused of being a Nazi spy. The timelessness of R.K.Narayan's stories enable us to focus more on the characters themselves, and why they act the way they do. Reading The Guide, I was once again reminded that R.K.Narayan's simplicity is a facade hiding complex thoughts and emotions.
