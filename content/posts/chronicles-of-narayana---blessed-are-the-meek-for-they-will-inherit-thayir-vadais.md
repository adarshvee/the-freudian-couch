Ten year-old Z.Narayanan was so excited that he woke up at 4 A.M., which was a personal record. He started to get up, but a loud noise from beside him made him pause and reconsider. Ever since Narayanan could remember, Mohan uncle had been the virtual head of their extended family, and he possessed a snore worthy of that position. Mohan uncle was the only family member that terrified Narayanan, and he could not picture his uncle being happy about his slumber being disturbed. "Shush!", he whispered to himself, and immedietely sneezed. Pushpa aunty, who was lying down on the other side of the large hallway, moved around a bit; but everyone else was still. With a whispered curse of self-admonishment, Narayana tried to wriggle out of his bedsheet, only to realize that Mohan uncle was lying over one end of the bed-sheet. Hopelessly trapped, he decided to try and get back to sleep. He lay fidgeting for the next hour though, &nbsp;anticipating his trip to Thenkudi that afternoon.</div>

Thenkudi was, at that point of time, Narayanan's favorite-est place in the Universe. Much later in his life, Narayanan would realize that the place held an attraction for him only because his cousins and most of his extended family had lived there. Growing up in Chennai, Narayanan always looked forward to his summer vacations with his cousins, and envied the fact that the cousins lived and grew up together. He had been ecstatic to learn that his cousins would stay in his house, and he had pestered his father to book a ticket along with them when they returned. After all, his own summer vacation would start in a week.<br />
<br />
Pushpa aunty was the first person to wake up. Noticing that Narayanan was awake, she urged him to brush his teeth and made him <i>golden-coffee</i> - a hint of caffeine and a lot of sugar with a large cup of milk. Groggy eyed relatives stirred one-by-one. An unspoken, informal order to use the single bathroom was quickly decided by the ladies for everyone to freshen up and get ready. The rest of the morning was a blur. Narayanan barely concentrated on the instructions his mother was giving him while packing his bags. She, along with Narayan's father Mr.Zeyachandran, would be joining the others at Thenkudi a week later. Their family auto-driver Arumugam anna came a few minutes later and he had brought a few of his colleagues too. Amidst the noisy goodbyes, Narayanan received his final instructions from Mrs.Zeyachandran : "take care of your clothes" and "take care of your health". In that order. Four autos left the house, looking like a Presidential convoy of a low-budget economy. Mohan uncle had strategically split the crowd such that each auto had only one child, and at least one adult male. In the secret race-of-autos conducted between the the little cousins, Narayanam's auto came an average third. Like him, it was neither good enough nor bad enough to draw attention.<br />

They reached the railway station an hour before Vaigai express was scheduled to depart.<br />
