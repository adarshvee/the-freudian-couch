Once upon a time, a Hare and a Tortoise happened to meet at a village. Being old acquaintances but not close enough to be friends, they greeted each other warmly, stopped by to make a courteous conversation, and wished each other luck before parting their ways. The Hare galloped North, following rumors that a trove of vegetables was discovered about 50 <i>yojanas</i> away. The Tortoise headed towards the river to their east, in pursuit of weeds.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Few hours later as the Tortoise made its laborious journey, it heard its name being called out loud. Turning back, it recognized the familiar face of its friend, &nbsp;<i>Samaja </i>the crow.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hello, where are you headed?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hi hello, glad to meet you! I am planning to settle on the river banks, where there's enough supply of weeds to last a few years"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Haven't you heard about the news from North?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What news? About the vegetables?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Yes, everyone is headed there. I just saw saw the Hare rushing towards it. Why are you not going?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Oh, that's nice. Personally, I prefer weeds. "</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What's the matter with you? No one prefers weeds over vegetables."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"But I don't like vegetables!"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"So what? With vegetables, you can buy anything. Even weeds! And it will last a lifetime."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hmm.. are you sure?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Of course I am sure. Do you think the Hare is a fool?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"But he is already halfway through! Before I complete the journey, he would have eaten up everything".</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Why do you want to give up already? With perseverance, hard work, will and determination, nothing is impossible for a man"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Dude, I am female. And I am a tortoise!"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Just because you are a female, or because you are a tortoise, are you any lesser than any man? Are you lesser than the Hare?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Of course not."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"The what are you waiting for? Run already. Go through the garden of <i>Aneet</i> as it is shorter"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Where are you going?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Oh, just here and there"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Okay, thanks for your valuable advice."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Saying thus, the Tortoise chugged along diagonally towards the vegetable patch.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Meanwhile, the crow went around the forest, liberally doling out advice, some solicited and some unsolicited, to all its friends. A couple of days later, it happened to be passing towards the vegetable patch when it heard loud snores from a bush nearby. Curious, it flew down, and identified its good friend, the Hare, who had just started stirring a little.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hi there! What are you doing here?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hi, I wanted to sleep"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"I thought you were at the vegetable patch! Did you find it? It must be only 10 <i>yojanas</i> from here"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Huh! I gave up on it. I realized that my passions are more towards sleeping."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"That's stupid! Who wants to sleep all the time? Everyone is headed towards the vegetable patch, like wise people ought to be. In fact, even the Tortoise must be quite close to it by now."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"The Tortoise? Wasn't he headed towards the River?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"He was. He changed his mind. "</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Heh, doesn't he not like vegetables?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"No one in a proper frame of mind ever dislikes vegetables. I say you are wasting your time here!"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"You think so? Where would the Tortoise be now?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"He should be quite close to the vegetable patch."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hmm, then he will reach there first and eat up all vegetables! I would rather stay here and sleep."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"With perseverance, hard work, will and determination, nothing is impossible for a man. And rabbits. Why are you giving up so soon? With your speed, you should outrun her."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Maybe. But are you sure about this vegetable thing?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Completely. You are wasting your time here."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Okay. What do I know? You sound so confident. I better get started"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"That's great! Good luck."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"And hey, thanks a lot. I owe you ."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Ahh, forget it. The pleasure is in guiding people to a right path"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So the Hare set off at great speed. The Tortoise, meanwhile, had almost completed it's tedious journey. The vegetable patch was just a <i>yojana </i>away. But the Hare had the advantage of rapidness.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So, who won the race? The Hare, or the Tortoise? And more importantly, what happened to the mysterious crow? Well, who the heck cares! I am too busy chasing vegetables.</div>
