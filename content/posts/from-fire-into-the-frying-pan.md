<span style="text-align: justify;">My taste in music is not unlike my physique. I live with it, and I don't really mind it. I even like it at times. But I have a vague feeling that others would not approve, and I hesitate to bare it in public. It probably stems from the fact that I am a dilettante with regards to music, and I will never be able to explain why I like the songs I do. I just like them. Take my current most favorite band among those performing English songs -- </span><i style="text-align: justify;">Flight of the Conchords</i><span style="text-align: justify;"> -- which consists of a comedic duo disguising themselves as musicians. It is only fitting that I am mildly addicted to them. Here is a song titled "<i>Humans are Dead</i>" performed by them:</span></div>

Describing a futuristic World where the humans are dead, "<i>there are no more elephants</i>", quips one of them. "<i>There is no more unethical treatment of elephants either. The World is a much better place</i>", adds the other. The World is a much better place. How true it is of current times!</div>

According to an evolutionary psychologist Steve Pinker from Harvard University, we are living in the most peaceful era of human existence. There is a consensus among a lot of people that this is true, despite the violence around us. One explanation for thinking so is that there seems to be a lot of violence today just because news from almost all corners of the globe reach almost all other corners of the globe. Just take Europe and contrast its peaceful present with almost all of history, when it was a hotbed of violence. How many countries do you know of where slavery is legal? Women are still fighting for equality, and they are arguably in a better position than they have ever been. Homophobia is still prevalent, but even the knowledge of such an issue is a recent addition to our humaneness, and there is a voice out there against homophobia.</div>

Healthcare has improved by leaps and bounds. Life expectancy has increased. Democracy is generally being favored over monocracy , oligarchy and other political systems. And comfort! A lot of our lives are filled with luxuries unimaginable a few years ago, thanks to technology. Science knows more than it ever has. And scientists all around have more freedom they have ever had. Just contrast it with the times were any disposition towards science was treated with disdain and violence.<br />
Religion is becoming a rarity.</div>

Yet, things are not all agreeable as it could be. Internet was invented as a means to save our time, yet it sucks most of it.&nbsp;</div>
