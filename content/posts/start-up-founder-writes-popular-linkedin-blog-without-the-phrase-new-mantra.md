In an astounding innovation, the founder of the Bangalore based start-up Pindrop Solutions, Mr. Mahesh Subramanian, published a 1200 word Linked blog without using the phrase "new mantra" even once. Yes, you read it right - not even once! His blog titled "Disrupting the future with Internet of Things" became instantly popular and is still being widely liked and shared in Linkedin - the professional social networking site.<br />
<br />
"This is where companies like ours have a huge advantage," he added. "Take SMaRT-PIns for example, one of our most exciting products. A smart pin looks just like a normal pin used for sewing clothes. However it uses IoT technology to send a constant data stream to a centralized servers hosting noSQL database." &nbsp;Using sophistaed data"<br />
