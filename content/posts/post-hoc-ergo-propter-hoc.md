I recently came across this philosophical term "Post hoc ergo propter hoc" which literally translates from Latin to "after this, therefore because of this." The term indicates the fallacy in assuming that just because an event A occurs after event B, event A was caused by event B. &nbsp;It is probably such assumptions in everyday life that cause us to believe in superstitions. I could, at this time, point out the various superstitious beliefs held in our country. But it is a common enough fallacy committed by most of us. After&nbsp;doing decently in my first mock CAT exam 4 years back, I continued with the same staple diet of one plate Poori-Masal, a cup of tea, and a five-rupee diary milk chocolate for all my subsequent mock CATs. If someone had challenged me to change my routine before such an exam, I would have retorted with a modified version of Pascal's wager (The French mathematician Blaise Pascal urged agnotists to convert to theists. If there were no God, he reasoned, and you believed in one, you end up loosing on some pleasures of life. If there is God, and you do not believe in one, you might end up burning in hell. When in doubt, choose the path with least risk.)<br />

Reading about "post hoc ergo propter hoc" reminded me of a story told by a maths teacher in during my 11th class. I was quite surprised that a few of my friends haven't heard the story, and I decided to pen it. When he told it, it was just a short, well-told joke. When I tell it in my own round-about-way, it ends up as a (possibly boring) story.<br />
