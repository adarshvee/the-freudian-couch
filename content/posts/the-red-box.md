There is this fairly popular college, and a narrow road
opposite to the college. At the end of this road, you will reach an Indian Bank
branch where the road turns left. Follow the road, and it turns
right immediately. A few meters later, there is a right turn. There is a
straight road here, but be careful not to take that. Remember, the road you are
going in is a bus route, so keep following the relatively largest road if you
get confused. After this right, keep going straight until the road ends at a
junkyard. Turn left here, and we live in the second house towards the right,
just after the parked dirty red car. But then, the dirty red car isn't parked
there anymore. If you observe closely though, there is a car shaped depression
on the ground - a testimony to how often the car stood there, providing shelter
to numerous generations of various canine breeds.<o:p></o:p></div>

We sold our car a couple of months back. For over the past fifteen years,
we have lived in the suburbs of Chennai. When we first moved in around this place,
my dad joked to his friends that we lived near Trichy. He travelled a distance
of nearly 60 KM every day to work in public buses, a journey of
at least 2 hours each way. The toughest part of this was getting to the “main
road” from our house. There are buses going out from here once every hour. You
miss one, and you can safely walk back home, take a nap, wake up, freshen up,
drink a beverage, walk back to the bus stand and get the next bus. Our weekend
movie shows were day long affairs, consisting of auto rides, bus rides, train rides
and long walks. We would try to combine as much work that can be done in the
“city” as we could into single trips. A movie, some purchase, and South Indian
meals for lunch. Buying a car changed all this. Suddenly, we could watch a
movie in the morning and be back home for lunch. <o:p></o:p></div>

I did not want a car. For some strange reason, I was set against
it. My mom and dad however had decided that my driving lessons should not go
waste, and they concluded that the best option for a house without anyone who
can drive would be a “second-hand” car. I accompanied them to various used car
dealers, always with a non-committal look which conveyed “don’t ask me, do
whatever you want”.&nbsp; We were at a
dealers’ in ECR when I let out my first sign of interest. It must have been the
red-ness of it that drew me. That, and the black cover that enclosed the
steering wheel. I took a closer look, examined the 2006 model Maruthi Alto, and
told my dad who had stopped to observe me that this one looked good. We hired a
cab to the dealers the next day, &nbsp;and requested the cab driver to inspect the vehicle. “The
engine is in good condition”, he remarked, “but if you are spending so much,
why don’t you spend a little more and buy a brand new one?”.&nbsp; We dealt with the advice the same way most
people deal with advice, heed to half of it and ignore the other half.<o:p></o:p></div>

For the first two months, I totally lacked the confidence to
drive. I had learnt driving from an instructor who was proud of teaching his record ("none of my students have failed the license test!"), and
I had learnt well. But driving a well-oiled driving-school car optimized to make
it very easy for one to pass driving tests is vastly different from driving an
used car with a weak clutch. We hired various call drivers for the whole of two
months. We would randomly go out to places, and if I behaved well, the drivers
would let me ride for a tiny bit of the journey, instructing me from the
co-passenger’s seat. The first time
I parked the car in my own house’s parking lot, I failed miserably trying to
reverse up the steep slope, and crushed against the edge of our house’s gates
as my father looked on helplessly. Thankful to the decision of buying an used
car, we coolly parked the car outside the gate and went on with the day.
Outside the gate was were the car stood for five years, through hot Chennai
summer and at least one record-breaking spell of rains.</div>

My first ever successful drive was to a movie. The driver we had arranged didn't turn up, and I offered to drive. My family was game enough to agree. Throughout the one hour journey, my usually talkative family sat in pin-drop silence, biting their nails and offering prayers. Only after I went down the winding path of the basement parking lot did they break their silence, and they did this by clapping. Since then, my confidence in driving only increased.<br />
<br />
Family functions, visiting relatives, shopping for festivals, picking up people from the railway station/airport, everything became easier. The red car has been a part of many major landmarks in each of our lives, especially mine.<br />

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">We have a car, and it is red in colour. The red assumes
significance because it is probably what drew me in the first time my eyes fell
on it. That, and the steering wheel, enclosed in a black cover. It was love at
first sight!<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">I had never wanted
us to buy a car, but my parents were insistent. My dad and I visited a second
hand car dealer at ECR to have a look at a few cars he had advertised. I was
aloof throughout the car hunting process. But as soon as I spotted this one, my
eyes lit up. "This one looks good, pa!" Happy enough that my interest
had finally been aroused, my parents swiftly brought the 2005 model red
coloured, overpriced, used Maruthi Alto home.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">We live in a
suburban area technically outside Chennai, where there is roughly one bus every
hour connecting us to the outside world. When my dad had initially bought a
house here, he joked to his colleagues that he had bought a house on the
outskirts of Trichy. A visit to the cinemas would cost us a whole day, with
multiple autos being hired through the journey. The alto made a big difference
to us. Suddenly, we could watch a movie in the morning and be back home for
lunch. Family functions, visiting relatives, shopping for festivals --
everything became easier.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">I had a license,
and I had learnt to drive from a very effective and demanding driving
instructor. But I was not confident enough to venture into the mad roads of
Chennai yet. For one complete month, we hired various call drivers who would
drive us around. They would let me drive for short stretches on the road, while
advising me on what to do and what not to do. As a result, I ended up absorbing
a variety of advice, some reinforcing the earlier ones, and other
contradicting. That my family is just an extension of me, and that I am its
product, can be seen in most aspects. We would insecurely ask each of the
drivers what they thought about the car itself. The invariable reply would be
that the engine is good, the wheel is slightly non-aligned, and the pick-up is
not great. The description could fit the whole of my country itself.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Roughly one month
after we brought the car, we booked for a movie at the Express Avenue mall. All
dressed up, we discovered that the call driver won't be turning up. "Let
me drive", I offered. My parents were not confident enough, yet. I talked
them into agreeing, and drove the complete 25 KM, with my nervous family
sitting with bated breath. As soon as I negotiated the winding, sloping pathway
to the basement parking lot at the mall and stopped the car, mom and brother
cheered and clapped. I became a confident driver. Sometimes, too confident.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">While driving the
car became easier, taking care of it has never been easy. It doesn't help that
none of barely know anything about the mechanics of a car, or how to maintain
one. By using a cloth to wipe dust out of the car, we have scratches on the
windshield. Once, my brother and I tried starting the car, and were stumped to
find that the steering seemed to be stuck. We panicked and alerted our neighbour,
who then patiently explained that the steering is designed to get locked, and
showed us how to unlock it. Another time, I had made the foolish error of
leaving the lights on when turning off the engine. This drained the battery.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Post this, my mom
and I were on the way to this mall to watch English Vinglish, and I was
careless enough to let the engine stall just at the entrance of the mall. To
our shock, the car wouldn't start.&nbsp; The car battery was out. After a few
unsuccessful attempts at starting the car, we quickly took help of an amazed
parking attendant and pushed the car to a random corner, left it there, and
rushed to watch the<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> movie. On
the way back, we jump-started the car, and I had to drive all the way back with
the thought that if I stall the engine again, it wouldn't start. We used this
jump-start technique quite a few times, and various mechanics told us it would
not have been possible with a non-Maruthi car.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">There was a reason
my dad had initially wanted a used car. His idea was that we could buy a brand
new car once we learn to drive well. Meanwhile, we need not worry about
scratching the car, or messing up with the gearbox. The first scratch was,
fittingly, while I was trying to park the car in our own house. I failed
miserably in trying to park at the elevated, narrow parking space. We
eventually decided to park the car on the street itself. There was a another,
very mild scratch when I took an ill-advised right turn on a jam packed street
and brushed an auto. Strangely, the deadliest accidents the car has been were
when it was parked. The first time, the family staying across our house brought
a brand new car, and they were getting ready for their first ride, a visit to
the church. They had hired a college student driving part time for pocket
money. While reversing out of their garage, the young driver completely lost
control, and crashed our car standing on the opposite end. The poor boy was
apologetic, and he bore the complete cost for the damages.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">We were not so lucky
the second time, when I was abroad. A speeding fast-track taxi driver hit our
car head-on. When the neighbors gathered around and made a scene, his manager
called up a cop he knew. The end result was that the fast track driver walked
away scot-free, and we had to avail the vehicle insurance to get the car fixed.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">My first long trip
was to Hosur, and it was unexpectadly smooth.My second long trip was much, much
more eventful.&nbsp; I had just returned from Qatar, and decided to drive along
with the family to Bangalore, despite the fact that the car had lay unused in
rain and sun for a long time. Racing at 120 kmp/h, we heard a blast. Knowing
Indian roads, I dismissed it as some stray plastic bottle and rode on for a
while. But something seemed wrong, and when I stopped to look, I realized that
the front tire had burst, and peeled away completely. We were very fortunate
that we had just stopped outside a mechanic's hut. We also happened to have a
stepney, and the mechanic changed it for us (we do not even know how to change
the wheel). The mechanic though, pointed us to another tire, and warned us that
it won't last long too. We nervously drew to Bangalore, attended my cousin's
marriage, and returned back. Dad, who didn't join us on the way back, warned me
to have a lot of cash and get a new spare wheel before driving. I heeded to the
first advice, but not the second. For every small crack that was heard, I
stopped the car to check if the particular wheel was all right. A few
kilometers after Krishnagiri, there was a definite burst<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">We rarely wash the
car. On most weekdays, it lies outside collecting dust. When required, we
quickly dust it and use it.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">&nbsp;"We
have a box with four wheels. It takes us from one place to another, but don't
expect anything else". "Eat good heavy breakfast if you are coming in
my car. You might have to push it if it stops". "Leave the car
outside, unlocked. If someone steals it, they would return it back".&nbsp;
D&nbsp; If our car were human, he would be hurt at the way we treat him. Or
maybe not. He would hopefully recognize how fond we are of him, despite our
constant jokes aimed at him.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
