It rained last night in Chennai, and the morning was uncharacteristically pleasant. However weekdays are office days, and I ignored the desire to laze and doze off. As I put on my shoes, my right feet had trouble fitting into the shoe. I took a closer look, and realized that sitting inside was a huge, huge frog the size of my clenched fist. Imagine the surprise both of us must have had - him more so than me. The poor fellow had found himself a nice, cozy and dark little place to park himself for a while, and I had rudely barged in feet first. I hurriedly upturned the shoe to let him down. Aided by gravity, he leapt off the shoe, did a Produnova, and landed feet first on the ground. He didn't respond to my concerned inquiries on his well-being - being simultaneously shocked and furious . I gave up after a couple of attempts. When I stole a last glance at him as I left, he was still still, staring at a far distance. I almost pushed him out of my mind - a rare two minute distraction on a workday - and went back to my boring existence.</div>

Except, something was still nagging me. It took me a while to realize it. This frog which had an under-appreciated skill at gymnastics resembled another frog. From another day at the onset of monsoons. Another workday. I had been rushing to office then, riding my bike at an inadvisable speed in a tiny street. Realizing that I was going too fast, I glanced at my speedometer. That's when he jumped at my face, right off the dial. I forced my bike to stop, pushed him away and rode one. A rare two minute distraction on a workday. Now, when was this? A year back? Two years back?</div>

The problem is, I honestly don't know. Things have been a blur, moving rapidly at the speed of a week per every blink of an eye. A lot has happened, and nothing has.&nbsp;</div>
