<div style="text-align: justify;">
Supriya was my schoolmate, but we barely knew each other at school. She ended up at the same college as I, but we would still exchange only a word or two when we came across each other occasionally. I did know that she writes poetry and started publishing them online around the time I started writing, but she was totally unaware that I blogged. I don't remember how (I suspect I asked her to read it. How else?), but she stumbled upon the blog. Around a year and a half back, she was one of the most frequent readers, reading posts at a stretch and encouraging me. It was around this time that I decided to make my blog more about me, regardless of what I end up revealing about me and regardless of how boring it is to the readers. Her feedback -- especially when I wrote intensely personal posts such as <span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://adarsh89.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-depression-flowchart.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">The Depression Flowchart</span></a> </span>-- helped me a lot in making this shift.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I would call Supriya a feminist, but I believe she is a fierce individualist first. She has strong views, and rarely hesitates to voice them. She also keeps surprising me with things I keep discovering about her. She is an outdoor type, but she is also a voracious reader, reading books at a furious pace and writing in multiple languages. She is, literally, a rocket scientist. She pens poems on extremes of joy and hope, extremes of grief and despair, and on other trivialities in between. She writes prose too, but not as frequently. Her prose often gives an impression that it is meandering, but there are profound observations and glimmers of humour hidden in them.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
When I asked her to write for me, she was not able to summon up the inspiration to write anything. She wanted me to post something she had already written, and suspected that not a lot of people had read. I would have chosen the stunningly pessimistic <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/04/tunnel.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Tunnel of Downfall</span></a>, or the lovely <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/04/tell-me.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Tell Me</span></a>. I would have published <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/04/spring.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Spring</span></a>&nbsp;which is so unlike what I know of her, or the colourful <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/04/paint-me-picture.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Paint Me a Picture</span></a>. I loved <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-wish.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">I Wish</span></a>, and <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/08/void.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">A Void</span></a>&nbsp;which is filled with so much anguish that it made me squirm. There is <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2009/08/moment.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">A Moment</span></a>&nbsp;which captures the beauty of the World, the passionate&nbsp;<a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2010/10/you.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">You</span></a>, and the exhilaratingly happy <a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2012/04/meeting-with-star.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">A meeting with a star</span></a>. Talking of happiness, there is this profound essay<span style="color: blue;">-- </span><a href="http://redgiantsandwhitedwarfs.blogspot.com/2014/04/can-i-dry-clean-my-melancholy-suit.html" style="color: blue;" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Can I dry clean my melancholy suit, please?</span></a> on the importance of feeling a little melancholy now and then, with which I completely agree. But Supriya bossed me around (she is capable of doing that to stronger minds than mine) into choosing a poem I haven't been able to decipher completely. She feels it to be her best work till date, despite (because of?) it being as abstract as her. So, on her request/command, here is <b>Poison Ivy.</b></div>

<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Last summer</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I often saw you near the pier</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">prickling my skin</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">like poison ivy</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Shooting memories into my veins</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">where have I seen you before?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">may be some other life</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">a different time</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Intangible as a shadow&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">you appear dark inside</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">or do you shade me?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wish I knew</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The more I seek</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">the more you slip away</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">you try to forget me</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">as I forgot you</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Sublimely</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">you evaporate, but</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">take it along with you</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">the poison ivy.</span></div>
</div>
