I had this habit from my birth. I used to wonder upon things that have a simple, practical solution. I took a very long time in understanding some basic rules of the World. As a result, maybe I ended up understanding them, like certain other things, better. For example, I used to wonder why people dont always stay together. I always thought in a group, everything was always unanimous. I understood the meaning of the word 'ego' a lot later than others around me. It took a lot of time for me to understand the most basic principle of economics, that price is directly proportional to demand. I used to wonder why people dont increase prices when demand is low and reduce it when demand is high, so that the multiplied factor could be kept a constant.<br />
<br />
I did warn you that I will branch out a lot. The point here is that I always used to wonder why people update their blogs atleast twice a day initially, and then as time flows, forget about it totally. I think I know the answer now - when you have the momentum, don't stop! So, here is my second post..<br />
<br />
I grew up with the idea that rules are never to be broken. As a result, I had a firm belief in God. I thought that God was omnipresent, and was always watching me, and my thoughts too. As a result, I tried to control my thoughts too. But somewhere down the line, I started losing the belief gradually. I went to temples only when my parents asked me to, and didnt follow many of the rules laid out before us. But, I still didnt change my idea of right and wrong. Brtween tenth grade and twelfth grade, I had become an agnostic. I didnt pray a lot, but was still afraid to offend Him. I used to tell myself that regardless of whether or not God exists, faith is necessary. It is faith that keeps a lot of things together, and without faith, the World will be full of chaos.<br />
<br />
I got mediocre marks in my board exams, and ended up taking a Biotechnology in SASTRA University. Not that I have anything against the course, I believe that all subjects are good. But, I and Biotechnology were poles apart. Surprisingly, my academic performances in my first year were fantastic. Others thougth, "here's a genious", and I thought "God is Great!". I followed my own religion. I didn't pray in the usual meaning of the word. Occassionaly, when I was not able to sleep, I would just talk to God. I still didn't go to temples unless someone wanted me to go with them. I belived that all God wanted from me was to do no evil, and He doesn't expect me to be an ascetic. This was the most religious period in my life.<br />
<br />
Then, during the end of my second year, I read Ayn Rand. I didn't become a follower of 'Objectivism', but my outlook towards life did change. I still didn't loose my belief in God, but the intervals between my talks with Him were becoming longer, till I stopped it altogether somewhere around the middle of my third year. I started leaning more towards atheism.<br />
<br />
There were many other changes in me as I completed my fourth year. My academic performances started to dip slightly.   </div>
