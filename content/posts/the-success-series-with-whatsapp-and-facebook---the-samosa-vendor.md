<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hidden amongst all the bleak, dreary, depressing and pessimistic thoughts in my blog, there lies a promise I once made -- that I will explain the immensely significant impact of motivational quotes on me. Promises are meant to be kept. I have been receiving millions of motivational messages on WhatsApp, Facebook and increasingly rare face-to-face conversations. Since I am yet to give up the belief that my blog would be seen by history as a one of the most creative human achievements ever, I decided to share a few of these "must-read" messages as a part of a "Success Series". Future students who read this blog as a part of this school syllabus may take note of the important messages, and live their lives accordingly. I would also leave a short write-up of my own thoughts on, and my interpretations of the messages at the end. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here is a message I got recently. Reproduced as it is, except for the bolding of the title</span></div>
<br />
<span style="color: #20124d;">[Fist Punch smiley] Must Read.....</span><br />
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span>
<b><span style="color: #20124d;">The Samosa Vendor</span></b><br />
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">“Today in India its unbelievable .......</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">The numbers are a little difficult to swallow, ......</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">But interesting nevertheless.”</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">It was my regular train journey home from work. I boarded the 18:50pm train from churcugate. When the train was about to leave marinelines, a samosa vendor with an empty basket got on and took the seat next to me. As the compartment was sparsely occupied and my destination was still far away,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #20124d;">I got into a conversation with him.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "Seems like you've sold all your samosas today."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor (smiling): "Yes. By God's grace, full sales today."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "I really feel sorry for you people. Don't you get tired doing this tiresome job the whole day?"</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "What to do, sir? Only by selling samosas like this every day do. We get a commission of 75 paise for each samosa that we sell."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "Oh, is that so ? How many samosas do you sell on an average each day?"</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "On peak days, we sell 4,000 to 5,000 samosas per day. On an average, we sell about 3,000 samosas a day."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">I was speechless.....for a few seconds. The guy says he sells 3,000 samosas a day; at 75 paise each, h</span><span style="color: #20124d;">e makes about 2,000 rupees daily, or 60,000 rupees a month. That's Rs. 60,000 a month. OMG.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #20124d;">I intensified my questioning and this time it was not for time pass.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "Do you make the samosas yourself?"</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "No Sir. we gets the samosas through a samosa manufacturer</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">And we just sell them. After selling we give him the money. And gives us 75 paise for each samosa that we sell."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">I was unable to speak a single word more but the vendor continued...&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">"But one thing...most of our earnings are spent on living expenses. Only with the remaining money are we able to take care of other business."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "Other business? What is that?"</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "It is a land business. In 2007 I bought 1.5 acres in Palghar for 10 lakh rupees and I sold it a few months back for 60 lakhs. Now I have bought land in umroli for 20 lakh rupees."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "What did you do with the remaining amount?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "Of the remaining amount, I have set aside 20 lakhs for my daughter's wedding. I have deposited the other 20 lakhs in the bank."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "How much schooling have you had?"</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "I studied up to third standard; I stopped my studies when I was in the 4th standard. But I know how to read and write. Sir, there are many people like yourself, who dress well, wear a tie, wear shoes, speak English fluently and work in air-conditioned rooms. But I don't think you guys earn as much as we do wearing dirty clothes and selling samosas."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">At this point, what could I reply. After all, I was talking to a millionaire! The train chugged into khar station and the samosa vendor got up from his seat.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Vendor: "Sir, this is my station...have a good day."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">Me: "Take care."</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">What more is there to say...</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #20124d;">"<i>Never underestimate the Power of the Common Man</i>".</span></div>
<span style="color: #20124d;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
Dear Mr.Whoever-has-all-the-time-in-this-World-to-type-out-that-<strike>crap</strike>-content,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"What more is there to say" absolutely sums it up. Your splendid story spreads a very useful message -- that one must not judge others too soon. Your story discourages arrogance, and encourages us to get to know others; who might impart to us some valuable success lessons. &nbsp;Even if we momentarily put aside the moral core of your message, your story is an artistic achievement. It had me engrossed and entertained. The twist in the end was totally unexpected. The character development is admirable; the character arc of the narrator in your autobiographical story changes gradually but firmly from being a moron who judges people by their appearances to a moron who judges people by their wealth. This is exactly the message I want children to hear, so that they will grow into better individuals. Thanks for sharing your enthralling experience. I encourage you to keep spreading goodwill.</span></div>
