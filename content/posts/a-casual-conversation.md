I have always admired people who could strike up a conversation quickly. You can find these people everywhere, starting from a local train to a barbershop. They are armed with all the knowledge in the World. Travelling in a bus from Velachery to Vadapalani today, I got an opportunity to test my skills in the regard. It was not exactly a conversation, since my contribution was just periodic, seemingly intelligent questions. <br />
<br />
   It started like this. I had just found a seat just behind the driver in a bus, and was busy checking if I had enough money to buy the ticket. I happened to overhear my neighbour talking on a cell phone. He was explaining to his wife that he wouldn't be home. The reason was that he had to complete a short film he was doing, and send it to Kalaignar T.V. for some competetion.<br />
<br />
   Now, being in the final year of my engineering, the times are such that anything interests me, as long as it does not do with deciding my future. And for the past few days, short films have been attracting me. So, I waited for him to finish his calls, and, without any sense of shame at overhearing his phone chat, questioned him about the film. After some initial hesitation, he decided to try me, and engaged my whole journey. <br />
<br />
  He gave me three different 'concepts'. Since he mentioned to me in the passing "ennakku adipadiya English knowledge konjam kammi than", I can give an outline of them
