Note : This post is a part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://adarsh89.blogspot.com/2014/09/guest-posts-series.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Guest Post Series</span></a>.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Meet Vidhya, another contributor for a short story collection a few of us are hoping to publish soon. You have already met <a href="http://adarsh89.blogspot.com/2014/09/guest-post-series-bureaucrat-bloody-hell.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Shyam</span></a>, and you will be meeting the one remaining contributor soon. Vidhya has been reading my blog for less than a year, but she is one of my best readers. She quickly went through almost every nook and corner of the blog when she discovered it, and has since then let me know her thoughts on every single post I have written. On a few occassions, she is the only person getting back with her views, dispelling my doubts that I was deluded into thinking I had published something. It helps that she is a wonderful person, rarely capable of discouraging anyone other than herself.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
For an awesomely entertaining writer, Vidhya started blogging very late. "<a href="http://vidhya111188.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Random House Publications</span></a> - Random stuff written from my house" : these are the title and tagline of her blog. And as you come to expect from the tagline, the posts are hilarious. In&nbsp;<span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://vidhya111188.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-bottle-of-horlicks-and-spoon.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">A bottle of horlicks and a spoon</span></a>, </span>you will be busy laughing, sniggering and smiling at the jokes until you are hit by the beautiful idea behind the post. In <span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://vidhya111188.blogspot.com/2014/04/driving-woes.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Driving Woes</span></a>,</span> she makes you squirm at the thought of being anywhere in her vicinity when she is driving an automobile (despite her hastily added assurances to the contrary). And in <span style="color: blue;"><a href="http://vidhya111188.blogspot.com/2014/03/animal-whims.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Animals and their whims</span></a>, </span>she talks about her inexplicable (for me at least) love for cats, dogs and few other animals. I hope that you would be able to read her stories soon, and be as shocked as I was while encountering the unexpected mini-tragedies she manages to sneak in.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I have felt that Vidhya's humour works because of her tone. It gives an impression that she is completely unaware of the humour in her writing. There is also an air of mock-pompousness; she is anything but pompous in real life. She does this really well while writing about children, caricaturing people based on their minor quirks. I requested her to try and showcase this aspect of her writing, and she managed to do exactly that by recalling this rollicking incident from her childhood.</div>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Looks like Adarsh has decided
to scoot over and make room for people on his Freudian couch. It’s a nice place
this couch .Mostly because the choice of reading is quite good .Ranging&nbsp;
from the ridiculously complicated yet funny flowcharts, treatises on names ,
excellent book reviews and the philosophizing about entropy, about science ,
morality and Sam Anderson etc.(Wait Anderson? Cant be.. Mendes? No. Definitely
Sam someone).<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The guest post series got me
thinking, about guests.So today on the couch , you will hear from me , a story
from my childhood . One that involves guests. The fundamental question on
guests is of course “How many is too many?” . One or two is ok right? Alright,
I guess a small family of say perhaps four is acceptable too. What’s the
maximum number of guests you’ve had at home ?Don’t count the time when someone
was getting married. On a nice and&nbsp; lazy , month long school vacation,
when you’re usually expected only to eat your meals on time , have a bath
regularly and not be a menace to your mother, have you ever suddenly found your
house inundated&nbsp; with guests you couldn’t count with fingers from both
your hands? I have..<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We were forewarned of course,
my brother and I. A strange bonding had developed between us in anticipation of
our shared misery. The day my father told us that we would be having 17 people
from God's own country to stay with us for a week our voices rose to the same
pitch. We screamed the same questions to our father. "who are these
people", "do we even have that many relatives", "where will
they sleep", &nbsp;"how many kids are
there in the group, and more importantly "do they watch the same cartoons
as us?" . Father tried to answer our questions patiently. I'm sure he made
reasonable arguments. We didn't hear any of it. We were too shocked thinking
about the prospects. One vacation week without our daily dose of cartoon
network was not something we were accustomed to and&nbsp; none too eager to find out what it would be
like . My brother had a little bit more to worry about . He was the proud owner
of a noisy contraption which he would
plug in to the TV to play Mario and TMNT for hours on end .&nbsp; He was not able to bring himself to imagine God's own children
getting their hands on it. It was his&nbsp; life line.&nbsp; He did not reckon he can survive for long
without it , so stowing it away for a week was not a viable option.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So there we were, a pair of
spoiled brats, who didn't usually get along very well but suddenly we found
ourselves on the same side of the battle front.&nbsp;
Unwilling as we both were to share material things ( such as the TV
remote, the sofa , the distinctly demarcated regions of the bed ) with each
other , we were even more unwilling to have to share them with anyone else, let
alone a whole circus troupe. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br></span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We watched silently as our parents looked
worried too , wondering&nbsp; anxiously about
how we were to accommodate that many people. My brother became excited all of a
sudden and wanted to join in this discussion.&nbsp;
He rushed out of the room and returned with an exam pad , some papers
and a pen.&nbsp;&nbsp; He beckoned to me. I was
absolutely thrilled to be a part of whatever he was planning. He mostly never
includes me in things he did. He began to roughly sketch a plan of the house.
He quickly verified the demographics with my father&nbsp; again. "How big is child no 1?, how tall
is adult no 12? Are you absolutely sure its 17 ?”.etc. Of course my father had
only a vague idea . His patience was evidently wearing thin and we thought it
would be best to get out of his sight. We moved our conference to the adjoining
room. My brother intended to chart out all the spaces in our house that were &nbsp;unoccupied by furniture and other sundry items
that make up a household. He told me that we were going to help our parents by
coming up with a Master floor plan that would allocate&nbsp; sleeping area to all of the guests. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We were both completely
excited and we spent days planning it. No nook or cranny was spared. We heard
talk of a baby being a part of the troupe and assigned the staircase landing
area for it. We felt mighty proud of ourselves and went around importantly like
civil engineers, examining the floor, bending over it , trying to wear
intelligent expressions&nbsp; , knocking on
the floor checking the amount of noise generated, measuring random spaces with
our mother's inch tape and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">When the day finally came,
two mini vans squeezed in with difficulty into our tiny street and disgorged
our guests.&nbsp; The days and hours spent in
anticipation of their arrival had failed to prepare us for the stupendously
spectacular sight they presented.I was&nbsp;
stumped into silence by their sheer number. They were all uniformly in a
state of excitement that probably rivalled those of the electrons in the outer
most circle that your chemistry teacher claimed was the "highly excited
state". They spoke to each other loudly and happily&nbsp; in a tongue that would remain an
unintelligible song&nbsp; despite the number
of times I would hear it. It was evident that they were enjoying each other's
company.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br></span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I recall vaguely that my
mother braved the task of making idlis for everyone on the first day.
Enlightened by the experience, she had my father buy all the remaining&nbsp; meals of the day from the nearby Sangeetha
hotel.&nbsp; They all ate contentedly amid
loud ruckus and made themselves at home. My brother and I soon witnessed our
lazy vacation routine fall apart dramatically. Asianet would be on all through
the day instead of cartoon network , where more people sang as they spoke. The
video game set was not spared too. It was taken over by the&nbsp; youngest and the loudest . They seemed very
well acquainted with the tiny man climbing the endless walls and whenever he
fell we would hear one of them disappointedly exclaiming that he had indeed
hit&nbsp; the jump button and continue
attacking the controls on the joy stick long after "game over"
flashed on the screen .&nbsp; My brother
managed to elbow his&nbsp; way through and
joined in defiantly, claiming ownership rights.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Later that evening , after
everyone was well fed and there was nothing to do but sleep , my brother and I
proudly presented our master plan to our parents. My father was dumb struck and
we initially thought that was a good thing. He definitely had to be impressed
with the level of detail. Undeterred by the lack of vocal reaction from him or
our mother, we enthusiastically dragged them about the house showing them
exactly what we had planned. We began to debrief the guests&nbsp; too, quite pompously I might add. But for
once none of them had anything to say. Or sing. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br></span></span></div>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">One of the adults in the
group suggested that they would all camp at the terrace and everyone agreed
with mild sighs of relief. So that was that. The grand plan that had mighty
potential and could have saved the world even, was unceremoniously chucked.
Forlorn was I to see all the hard work go to waste but my brother? He didn't
care . He simply went back to his video game.&nbsp;

story . Perhaps there's a moral there somewhere ? Anyone who has spotted it can
let Adarsh know. I'm sure he will be kind enough to pass it on. Until next time
on the Couch!</span><o:p></o:p></span></div>
